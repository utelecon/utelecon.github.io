    Please refer to <a href="https://www.sodan.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/faq/utokyo-wifi-en/">ECCS Tutor’s page</a> as well if you are unsure. There are detailed connection instructions for each device.
    You may also refer to <a href="https://www.eduroam.jp/for_users/">the "User's Guide" on the page of the Wi-Fi system called "eduroam"</a>, which has a similar connection method (replace eduroam with UTokyo Wi-Fi SSID when you read the page).

      <summary>When this procedure does not work</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>If the signal is weak, the connection may be interrupted. Try different locations or times of the day.</li>
        <li>When you enter your user ID, please include the alphabetical part as well.</li>
        <li>Make sure you have entered the symbols in the password correctly. Try copying and pasting from the notification email.</li>
        <li>If you are copying and pasting from a notification email, please make sure that there are no extra spaces before or after the password.</li>
        <li>If you have multiple applications for an account during the process, only one of them will be valid; only the account listed in the <a href="https://acm.wifi.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/secure/user_applies/index/1/">UTokyo Wi-Fi account menu</a> will be valid, so please check.</li>
        <li>The trouble may be caused by devices which are not kept up to date. Old MacOS, Windows 8.1 or earlier, and other devices (smartphones, etc.) that have not been updated should be updated to the latest version before connecting.</li>
      </ul>
