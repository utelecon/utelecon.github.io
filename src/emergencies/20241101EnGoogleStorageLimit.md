<div class="box--alert">

  Currently, there is a problem in which the service on ECCS Cloud Email displays the message “Storage is full,” “Organization storage full,” “The file is view-only” or “You're out of storage,” and prevents writing operations. The main effects are as follows
  - Unable to upload files to Google Drive
  - Cannot edit Google Docs / Google Spreadsheets / Google Slides
  - Google Form does not accept response
  - Google Photos does not work.

  For details, please refer to "[Problem with write operation in ECCS Cloud Email](/notice/2024/1101-google-storage-limit/)" (in Japanese).
