The University of Tokyo has introduced multi-factor authentication to UTokyo Account to improve information system security.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which users prove their identity using at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, or other methods when signing into their accounts. Multifactor authentication improves security by reducing the possibility of someone being able to sign in to your account even if your password is known to someone else for some reason.

To improve the overall security of the university, UTokyo requires that you enable multi-factor authentication for your UTokyo Account. Some systems are set to be unavailable until multi-factor authentication is enabled.

  Please follow the setup procedures in the "[Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial)".
