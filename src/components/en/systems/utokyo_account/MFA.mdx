Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process in which users prove their identity using at least two pieces of evidence. In addition to passwords, users are asked to verify their identity via SMS, authentication applications, or other methods when signing into their accounts. To improve the overall security of the university, UTokyo requires that you enable multi-factor authentication for your UTokyo Account. Please follow the setup procedures in the "[Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial)".

Currently, some systems cannot be used until multi-factor authentication is enabled, and we plan to gradually expand the number of systems that are subject to such settings. For details, please refer to "[Multi-Factor Authentication is Mandatory for UTokyo Account](/en/notice/2024/mfa100-schedule)".
