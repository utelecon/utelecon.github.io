<div class="box">
Currently, there is a problem with Safari on macOS, iPhones, and iPads, where the password entered by the password autofill function fails to allow you to sign in after you have set a password for your UTokyo Account. To avoid this problems, please do not use the automatically generated password, but create a password of your own manually or by some other means, and be sure to remember it (or write it down in a safe place). Please refer to [this announcement for more information on how to deal with the problem of signing in](/notice/2023/0321-utac-password/) (in Japanese).
