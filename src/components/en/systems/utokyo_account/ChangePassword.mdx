1. You will receive the "Notification regarding password for the UTokyo Account", which will include your initial password from your faculty or graduate school.

2. <If cond={props.variant === "individual"}>
     Please log in to the "View Your UTokyo Account User Information" below with your UTokyo Account and initial password indicated on the notification.

        [View Your UTokyo Account User Information](https://login.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/my/)

      </Fragment>
   </If>
3. When requested to update your password, enter the initial password from the notification into the “Current password” field, and enter your new password in the field marked “New password” and "Confirm password".
    - A password must include at least three of the following four types of characters: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and must be between 12 and 64 characters long.
    <If cond={props.variant === "oc"}>However, the ECCS printing service (printer operation panel) limits a password to 32 characters, so we recommend that the password be set to 32 or less characters when using that system.
    <Fragment slot="else">However, the ECCS printing service (printer operation panel), the financial accounting system and budget execution management system limit a password to 32 characters, so we recommend the password be set to 32 or less characters when using these systems.</Fragment></If><br />
    **Note**: If you set your password using the initial password, it may take some time (up to approximately 30 minutes) before the system becomes available. Since it takes up to approximately 30 minutes for MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) settings to be reflected in the system, those who proceed to set up MFA next will experience minimal impact from the delay caused by password setting. Please proceed with the MFA setup and wait for a while until it takes effect (Activating MFA is required).
 4. Once you successfully log in, press "display information" button.  The page shows your status including Multi-Factor Authentication ("not using it") and Information Security Education ("have not taken").  Proceed to setting up Multi-Factor Authentication and Information Security Education.
