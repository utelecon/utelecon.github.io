However, it could be sent while testing different functions). If you are concerned, please perform this test in a situation that is safe for sending audio and video.
2. Access the test meeting room URL via the [UTOL test cource](https://utol.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lms/course?idnumber=20197J919010V02).

  - **You are asked to install the application when you access the meeting room URL, or the installation starts**: This happens when the application has not been properly installed. Please reinstall the application and access the URL again.
  - **When the message "This meeting is only for authorized participants" is displayed**: This happens when you have not signed in to Zoom with your UTokyo Account. The same is true if it is displayed as "Switch Accounts to Join". Click the "Sign in to Join‚Äù or "Switch Account" or "Switch Account to Join" button and sign in by following the instructions shown below in "Optional task: Sign in to the application".
