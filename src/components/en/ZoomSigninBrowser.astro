      Go to the <a href="https://u-tokyo-ac-jp.zoom.us/">UTokyo Zoom page</a> (please
      note that this is a Zoom sign-in page for UTokyo members only and is not a
      regular Zoom sign-in page).

    <p>

      <p>
        This happens when you are already signed in to Zoom with your existing
        account. Click the icon in the top right corner of the <a
          href="https://zoom.us/profile">Zoom settings page</a
        > and click “SIGN OUT." Then, return to the first step and access the UTokyo
        Zoom page again. <img

      will be displayed. Please sign in.

      If you see “Licensed” with your Common ID after clicking the icon in the
      top right corner of the Zoom settings page (a human silhouette or a
      profile picture that you have set up), you have successfully signed into
      Zoom with your UTokyo account.
