title: How to use a tablet to write on the board
---

In this page, we will show you how to use an iPad or other tablet to write on a board by hand or other tools in a class.

The writing is done on a tablet such as an iPad using a pen for tablets, and the writing is then shared on the screen via Zoom. Instead of a blank board, you can write on a PDF slide, or create a PDF file of your writing and distribute it after the class. There are several types of applications available, each of which supports different types of tablets and tablet pens. Here are some of the most popular ones.

- Using "**GoodNotes 5**" as an application
    - The tablet and pen are basically used with an iPad and Apple Pencil (Windows and Android are not supported).
    - It is a paid application and can be purchased for 980 yen.
    - Explanation article: **[Writing on GoodNotes 5](/en/articles/goodnotes-writing/)**
    - Practical example: [Good practices of online class / Dr. Tadashi Shiraishi, Law I](/good-practice/interview/shiraishi) (in Japanese) (A video presentation by Dr. Shiraishi is available only by on-campus members at [the 25th Online Class Information Exchange Meeting](/events/luncheon/2020-12-23/) page (in Japanese))
    - Practical example: [Good Practices of online class / Dr. Nobukazu Saito Computational Mathematics I, Computational Mathematics](/good-practice/interview/saito) (in Japanese)
- Using "**Microsoft OneNote**" as an application
    - It is supported not only by iPad but also Windows and Android tablets.
    - Basic functions are available for free. Additional paid functions are also available under the University of Tokyo's [UTokyo Microsoft License](/en/microsoft/).
    - Explanation article: **[Writing on OneNote](/en/articles/onenote-whiteboard/)**
    - Practical example: [Good Practice of Online Class / Dr. Kaoru Irie Mathematical Statistics I, II](/good-practice/interview/irie) (in Japanese) (A video report by Dr. Irie is available only by on-campus members at [the 20th Online Class Information Exchange Meeting](/events/luncheon/2020-11-18/) page (in Japanese))
- Using Zoom's "Annotate (Comment)" function
    - With Zoom, you can write handwritten "annotations (comments)" on a screen shared by screen sharing. You can also write on a blank whiteboard by selecting "Whiteboard" when sharing a screen. However, the function is limited, for example, you cannot scroll through the written content, so it is suited for quick writing.
    - You can find an explanation of how to use Zoom's screen sharing in [the "Annotate while sharing screen" section of the Zoom page](/en/zoom/usage/screen_sharing/#screen-annotation).
    - Practical example: [Practical example of online writing on a board using a tablet or electronic whiteboard](http://noneq.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/online_lecture.html) (Dr. Sagawa, Graduate School of Engineering)
- Using other methods
    - [Using a single Windows tablet to handwrite on PowerPoint and other documents while streaming via Zoom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj-xBZEgt-A) (Dr. Sasatani, Kawahara Lab., Information Science and Technology): Video demonstrates various ways to handwrite on a tablet.
    - [Using a PC and a tablet to give a blackboard-like lecture](/online/shared/pc+ipad.pdf) (Dr. Kumada and Dr. Suzuki, Engineering): They introduced how to connect an iPad and a PC using AirPlay or a wired cable, join Zoom on the PC, and share the screen written on the iPad via the PC. This method is useful when you want to teach while switching between slides and the board as needed.
        - For more information on this feature, please also refer to Zoom's official help "[Sharing your iOS screen from the Zoom desktop client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-iOS-screen-from-the-Zoom-desktop-client)".
    - [InkLecture](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/inklecture/index-j.html) (Dr. Igarashi, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology): He introduced "InkLecture," a simple board writing application for Windows 10.
