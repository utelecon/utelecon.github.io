title: How to Use a Document Camera to Share Lecture Notes With the Class
---

This page introduces how to use a document camera to share handwritten lecture notes in class. The method is to prepare a piece of paper, write on it with a pen, take a picture or video of it with a document camera, and transmit the picture or video via Zoom. The specific method depends on the model of the camera, but there are two types: one is to use the images from the document camera as a camera input for Zoom, and the other is to display the images from the camera on the screen and broadcast it via Zoom's screen sharing function. The key point is to use a thick pen and check the visibility of the pen in advance so that students can see what you have written.

The following is information on this method shared by a faculty and staff member of the University.
