title: How to take pictures of a blackboard or whiteboard and write on it
---


In this page, we introduce a method to take pictures of a blackboard or whiteboard with a PC camera and stream the pictures via Zoom for writing by hand in class. 

The key point is to check the visibility of the camera and the size of the text in advance so that the students can see what you have written.

Here is some information about this method that was shared with us by our faculty staff.
