title: Details on Webex System Change for Spring 2021
---
import WebexSignIn from './_webex_sign_in.md';

To facilitate online teaching and simplify technical operation, UTokyo ICT systems are updated. This page concerns Webex system change only. For information about other ICT systems, see “**[System Change for Spring 2021](/en/change2021s/)**”.

For the use of Webex, ECCS Cloud Email (1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp) and its password were previously indispensable. This is however no longer necessary. **Logging in with UTokyo Account is now possible**.

Your current account is scheduled to be transferred to your UTokyo Account on the following schedule.

**Date: March 12, 2021, 20:00 - March 13, 2021, 0:00 (Scheduled)**

## New Sign-in Methods

<WebexSignIn />

## Use of Webex Before/After the Transfer

### Basic Functions

- Joining or hosting Webex meetings will not be affected. Forced log-out will not happen during the transfer.
- Meeting settings will not be affected. Webex meetings scheduled before the transfer will continue to be available after the transfer. URLs will remain unchanged.

### UTokyo Account restricted Webex Meetings

- UTokyo Account restricted Webex meetings will not be affected. Users can participate in any Webex meetings scheduled before the transfer with their new accounts.
    - This setting can be viewed in “Schedule a meeting” > “Unlocked meetings”. Please change “Guests can join the meeting” to “Guests wait in the lobby until the host admits them” or “Guests can’t join the meeting.”

### Receiving emails from Webex

- Users will continue to receive email notifications from Webex (e.g. when a meeting is scheduled) via ECCS Cloud Email.
    - Email address for Webex account will become <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> (10 digits-ID + <code>@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>) after the transfer. Please note that such email address functions only for UTokyo ICT systems but not mailing. Any email notifications received will be forwarded to ECCS Cloud Email.

## Additional Information

### Creating a New Account

**Creating a new account is no longer necessary in the new system**. Webex accounts will be automatically generated from UTokyo Account. When starting to use Webex after the transfer, read the instructions on “New Sign-in Method”.

For more information, see “**[Preparing for Online Classes (for new students)](/en/oc/)**” and “**[Preparing for Online Classes (for new faculty members)](/en/faculty_members/)**”.

In addition, **existing application form sign-up service will be terminated.** (No new application will be accepted.) Department administrators should pay special attention not to provide outdated information to new faculty members.
