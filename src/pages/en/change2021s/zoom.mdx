To facilitate online teaching and simplify technical operation, UTokyo ICT systems changes are in progress. This page is about the changes in the use of Zoom. For information about other ICT systems, see “**[System Change for Spring 2021](/en/change2021s/)**”.

For the use of Zoom, ECCS Cloud Email (`1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) and its password were previously indispensable. This is however no longer necessary. **Logging in with UTokyo Account is now possible**.

**Date : March 14, 2021, 22:00 - March 15, 2021, 6:00 (Scheduled)**

## New Sign-in Method

<ZoomSignIn />

## Use of Zoom Before/After the Transfer

### Basic Functions

- Joining or hosting Zoom meetings will not be affected. Forced log-out will not happen during the transfer.
- Meeting settings will not be affected. Zoom meetings scheduled before the transfer will continue to be available after the transfer. URLs will remain unchanged.

### UTokyo Member Restricted Zoom Meetings

- Depending on the zoom settings, UTokyo member restricted meetings may be affected.
    - On the “Schedule a Meeting” page, if the option “require authentication to join” - “大学アカウントでサインイン (Sign-in with UTokyo Account)” is set to `*.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, the zoom meeting will remain available with UTokyo Zoom accounts after the transfer. It should be configured in this way if no changes have been made.
    - If the option is set to <code>@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>, users with UTokyo Zoom accounts after the transfer will not be allowed to join the zoom meeting. To fix this problem, click “Edit” and change it to `*.u-tokyo.ac.jp` (or <code><em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>).
- The function of sending non-UTokyo Account users to the waiting room will not be affected.
    - This setting can be viewed in “Waiting Room Options” > “Users not in your account.”
    - This setting is based on the contract users subscribed to, not the email domains.

### Receiving Emails from Zoom

- Users will continue to receive email notifications from Zoom (e.g. available cloud recording, settings regarding alternative hosts) via ECCS Cloud Email.
    - Email address for Zoom account will become <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> (10 digits-ID + <code>@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>) after the transfer. Please note that such email address functions only for UTokyo ICT systems but not mailing. Any email notifications received will be forwarded to ECCS Cloud Email.

### Signing in During the Transfer

The transfer is scheduled between March 14, 22:00 - March 15, 6:00. Users have to sign in with specific methods. Please check the following information in advance if you wish to use Zoom during the period.

- **Till March 14, 22:00 (Scheduled)**: Sign in with your existing 10 digits-ID ECCS Cloud Email <code>1234567890@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> and Zoom password.
- **From March 14, 22:00 to March 15, 6:00 (Scheduled)**: Depending on the transfer progress, sign-in methods may differ. One of the following three methods should be available. Please try logging in with them in the order presented. (It is expected that at least one of the methods functions properly.) We apologize for the inconvenience caused.
    - Sign in with <code>1234567890@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> (10 digits-ID ECCS Cloud Email) and existing Zoom password.
    - Sign in with <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> (10 digits-ID + <code>@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>) and existing Zoom password.
    - Sign in with the aforementioned new methods (see “New Sign-in Method”; Sign in with <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> and UTokyo Account password)
-  **After March 15, 6:00 (Scheduled)**: Sign in with the aforementioned new methods (see “New Sign-in Method”; <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> and UTokyo Account password)

## Additional Information

### Creating a New Account

**Creating a new account is no longer necessary in the new system**. Zoom accounts will be automatically generated from UTokyo Account. When starting to use Zoom after the transfer, read the instructions on “Accessing from Sign-in Page with UTokyo Account” in “New Sign-in Method”.

For more information, see “**[Preparing for Online Classes (for new students)](/en/oc/)**” and “**[Preparing for Online Classes (for new faculty members)](/en/faculty_members/)**”.

In addition, **please refrain from creating new accounts with existing procedures as problems may occur.** Department administrators should pay special attention not to provide outdated information to new faculty members(i.e. creating a Zoom account with ECCS Cloud Email <code>1234567890@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>).

### Using UTokyo Zoom with a Different Email

If you are using UTokyo Zoom with an email other than the 10 digits-ID ECCS Cloud Email `1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` (e.g. email address named after your choice `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`), signing in with UTokyo Account will not be available after the transfer.

If you wish to use this email address, signing in from the Zoom sign-in page [https://zoom.us/signin](https://zoom.us/signin) with its password is temporarily available. Please note that it is impossible to sign in from UTokyo Zoom page using a non-10 digits-ID account.

As previously announced, these Zoom accounts are to be terminated. You are advised to switch to the 10 digits-ID account. Please read “[Using Zoom with Non-UTokyo Account Sign-in](/en/notice/zoom-address-new)” on how to switch to the 10 digits-ID UTokyo Account `1234567890@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, after the transfer.

### Change in Zoom Meeting URLs

Along with the system change, URLs of Zoom meetings set up by UTokyo Accounts was changed to `https://u-tokyo-ac-jp.zoom.us/j/xxxxxxxxx?pwd=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. There will be no effects on participation in Zoom meetings.
