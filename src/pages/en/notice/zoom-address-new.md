title:  Using Zoom with Non-UTokyo Account Sign-in
---
<!-- ↑”Signing in to Zoom”の記事内で、本記事を参照している箇所あり。本記事のタイトルを変更する場合は、そちらにも変更を反映することが必要。-->

A Zoom account of the University of Tokyo is currently prescribed as an account that you sign in with your UTokyo Account (account with email address `[10-digit Common ID]@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, e.g. `1234567890@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`).

Therefore, **if you are currently NOT signing in to Zoom using your UTokyo Account (e.g. using ECCS Cloud Email addresses setup with the username you chose (`xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`)), please follow the instructions on this page to switch to a Zoom account that uses the UTokyo Account for sign-in** (account with email address `[10-digit Common ID]@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, e.g. `1234567890@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) **and use it from now on.**

Since we are in the process of migrating to a unified sign-in method to enable centralized management, we plan to take measures such as disabling the account in question in due course. Furthermore, some of these accounts are not granted licenses (paid functions) because they are different from the prescribed format, and have functional restrictions such as a 40-minute meeting time limit (a temporary measure to ease restrictions on accounts with university email addresses which ended in the spring of 2022). Therefore, please change your sign-in method as soon as possible.

    <summary>If you are signing in using your ECCS Cloud Email address beginning with your 10-digit Common ID (e.g. <code>1234567890@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>)</summary>
    Your Zoom account sign-in email address, e.g. <code>1234567890@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>, should have automatically changed to <code>1234567890@<em>utac</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> in the <a href="/en/change2021s/">System Changeover for Spring 2021</a>. Sign-in with the changed email address should already be recognized as a UTokyo Account sign-in. Therefore, the below manual changes are not necessary.   
    However, if you have manually created a new Zoom account using <code>1234567890@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code> as the sign-in email address after the System Changeover, the system will no longer let you sign in with it. Please follow the steps below to switch to an account that uses your UTokyo Account for sign-in.

## If You No Longer Need Your Current Zoom Account
{:#existing-account-is-unnecessary}

In the case that your account that uses non-UTokyo Account sign-in (e.g. accounts that use ECCS Cloud Email addresses setup with the username of your choice, `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) is no longer necessary, you can just abandon it and follow the instructions on the [Sign-in Methods for Zoom](/en/zoom/zoom_signin.html) page to start using the new Zoom account which uses UTokyo Account for sign-in.

<!--
The administrator will help delete your old account. Please submit the [UTokyo Zoom Unnecessary Account Declaration Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=T6978HAr10eaAgh1yvlMhHUY5ws7h1xGr9koV-KGC8RUNTBGSjJPN0ZWN0RIVFI2TVZZODZNT0xRRy4u).

## If You Want to Transfer Data to Your New Zoom Account 

Any UTokyo Zoom account that does not use a UTokyo Account for sign-in (e.g. a Zoom account that uses your ECCS Cloud Email with the username of your choice, `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) will soon be completely disabled. 

For a while, you will still be able to sign in to such accounts, but **please switch to your new Zoom account that uses UTokyo Account sign-in at the earliest possible**.

Steps for non-UTokyo Account sign-in are explained in the next section.

### Method of non-UTokyo Account Sign-in

For a while, you may still use Zoom with non-UTokyo Account sign-in after the [System Changeover for Spring 2021](/en/change2021s/) (such as accounts using your ECCS Cloud Email address with the username of your choice, `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`).   
To use Zoom with such accounts, please **visit the usual Zoom sign-in page, `https://zoom.us/signin`, and enter your previous sign-in email address and Zoom password**.
<details>
    <summary>If you cannot find your previously saved meeting information (meeting room, cloud recording, etc.) after sign-in </summary>
    This occurs when you use the new sign-in method instead of the aforementioned method for UTokyo Accounts. When you use the new sign-in method, a new Zoom account for UTokyo Account sign-in is automatically created, and you will be signed into this new account. You are not seeing your previously saved meeting information because the new account does not inherit the previous account's data.   
    To access your previous data, sign out of the new account, go to the usual Zoom sign-in page at <a href="https://zoom.us/signin">https://zoom.us/signin</a>, and sign in using the previous sign-in email address and Zoom password. </details>


### Switching to Sign-in with your UTokyo Account
{:#change-procedure}

If you are currently signing in to Zoom using the ECCS Cloud Email with the username of your choice (`xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`), please visit the [one-stop migration site](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utelecon-zoom-checker/home) (in Japanese) and follow the instructions to switch to UTokyo Account sign-in. Once the migration is completed, you will be able to sign in to Zoom using your UTokyo Account. The sign-in procedure can be found on the [Sign-in Methods for Zoom](/en/zoom/zoom_signin) page.

    If you currently sign in using (1) an ECCS Cloud Email address that begins with your 10-digit Common ID (e.g. <code>1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>), or (2) an email address other than your ECCS Cloud Email address, please follow the instructions below to manually switch to sign-in using your UTokyo Account.

        <li>
            After signing in, if you see your Common ID after clicking the icon in the top right corner of the Zoom settings page (a human silhouette or a profile picture that you have set up), you have successfully signed into Zoom with your UTokyo account.
        </li>

After migration, the license may appear as "BASIC" instead of "LICENSED". In this case, please wait until the next day and check again, as the license is granted on the day after the migration.

If the above procedure does not work, please contact the [Technical Support Desk](/en/support/).
