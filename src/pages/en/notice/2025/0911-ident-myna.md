title: Launch of the “UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service” and Procedures for Pre-link
---

We have launched the “UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service,” which allows you to use your My Number Card for identity verification in situations such as forgetting your UTokyo Account password or when multi-factor authentication stops working properly.

With simple steps, you can verify your identity and reset your password or other credentials. It can also be used for the “**[cloud data salvage](/en/systems/leave/salvage/)**” procedure, which allows access to data stored in the cloud in case you absolutely need it after graduation, resignation, or similar events.

Anyone with a valid UTokyo Account who possesses a My Number Card and a smartphone equipped with card reader functionality can use this service. However, **pre-linking is required** to use it. We strongly encourage you to complete this procedure in advance to prepare for future problems.

For details, please see the information on the following page. Some explanations are currently under preparation, but will be released sequentially.
