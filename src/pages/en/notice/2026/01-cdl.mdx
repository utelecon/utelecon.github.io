What kind of UTokyo would you like to create for your own learning?

The University of Tokyo is launching a new initiative called **“Our Campus Design Lab”**, where students and faculty work together to explore this question. Here, “learning” goes beyond formal classes and includes self-directed and extracurricular activities as well.

The Lab brings together three closely connected themes: **learning and interaction spaces**, **ICT environments**, and the **design of learning and careers**. Starting from issues students notice in their everyday campus life, members share ideas, develop proposals to improve the learning environment, and work toward turning those ideas into real practices and ongoing initiatives.

We are now inviting students to join the first phase of the Lab. You do not need any special experience or expertise—if you have ever thought, “I want to change something,” or “I want to make things a little better,” that is more than enough. Why not join us in shaping the future of learning at UTokyo?

## Our Three Focus Area

We focus on the following three interconnected aspects.

1. **Creating Diverse Spaces for Learning and Interaction**  
We explore spaces and systems that allow students to learn proactively from one another and collaborate freely. Examples include developing on-campus spaces for group work that are not limited by faculty or departmental boundaries.
2. **ICT Environments that Support Cutting-Edge Learning**  
We aim to create environments that enable new ways of learning by making use of rapidly evolving technologies and tools, such as AI, VR, and cloud computing.
3. **Supporting Students in Designing Their Own Learning**  
We consider support frameworks that help each student shape their own learning journey—from course planning and research activities to thinking about future career paths. By making the most of the learning opportunities available at the University of Tokyo, we aim to promote more flexible and self-directed learning.

## About the Activities

Lab members will work together with faculty and staff to develop concrete ideas for creating more engaging learning environments from these perspectives. Activities will begin by sharing feelings and simple ideas, and will gradually develop into deeper discussions, proposals, and practical initiatives.

Have you ever found yourself thinking things like:

- “There never seem to be enough power outlets in classrooms…”
- “I wish there were rooms where I could speak freely during online classes or seminars…”
- “I want a space where students can talk, think, and work together…”
- “I wanna try out the latest AI tools…”
- “I want hands-on experience with the newest VR devices…”
- “I can’t quite find courses that really match my interests…”
- “I wish I could choose courses across faculties more freely…”

Your first step may start from these very familiar thoughts. We believe that addressing such issues one by one will directly benefit students—and, in turn, help shape a better learning environment for the future of UTokyo.

## About the Learning Environment Enhancement Working Group

The Learning Environment Enhancement Working Group is a faculty–staff initiative established to explore what makes a truly attractive learning environment for students. Its members include several executives responsible for education and information across the whole university, along with staff from the departments overseeing education, information, and facilities utilization; the Library System; several colleges, faculties, and graduate schools; and the Center for Coproduction of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (IncluDE).

With both a broad institutional perspective and a strong focus on practical implementation, the group aims to support and collaborate closely with the activities of Our Campus Design Lab.
