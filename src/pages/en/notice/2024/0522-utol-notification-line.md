## Overview

The LINE notification function was implemented on [UTOL](/utol) on May 14, 2024, allowing users to receive notifications of content updates, information, and messages on LINE. Please note that when you use LINE Notify, the LY Corporation (hereinafter, referred to as "LINE Corp.") may acquire and utilize the information related to the notifications. For example, advertisements may be displayed on the LINE app when receiving notifications. Please be aware of this before using LINE Notify.

## Display of Advertisement

The UTOL LINE notifications use LINE Notify (<https://notify-bot.line.me/en/>). Similarly, it was confirmed that advertisements were being displayed (as of December 2023) on the LINE applications of users of ITC-LMS (discontinued in February 2024), which also used LINE Notify.

In accordance with its Privacy Policy (<https://www.lycorp.co.jp/en/company/privacypolicy/>), LINE Corp. may acquire various types of information about individual users and use it to deliver advertisements while providing all of its services, including the communication applications LINE and LINE Notify.

The Information Technology Center does not receive any profit resulting from the display of advertisements. Even if an ad is displayed in a notification from UTOL, we are not involved in what kind of advertisements are shown to which users.

## Information related to LINE notifications

### SNS Accounts for notifications

To receive various information from UTOL via LINE, you need to set up a LINE account as your "SNS account for notifications" in the "Personal Settings" from "Settings" in the upper menu after logging into UTOL.

You can only receive notifications via LINE if you have made changes to these settings. The Information Technology Center will not use the user's LINE account for any purpose other than notifications from UTOL.

### Information and Message Notifications

To receive notifications and messages about your courses from UTOL via LINE, you as a user need to set up an SNS account for notifications and then select "Receive by mail and LINE" or "Receive by LINE" in "Information/Message Notifications" in the "Personal Settings".
By setting this option, there is a possibility that LINE Corp. may obtain and use the contents of your emails and notifications.

### Updates Notifications

To receive **important updates** on the courses you are participating in via LINE, for example, "Online class information has been updated" or "New assignments have been added", you need to set up your own SNS account for notifications and select "Redirecting all information once a day" or "Instant transfer" in the "Updates information" section of the "Personal Settings". By setting this up, there is a possibility that LINE Corp. may obtain and use a summary of the updated information, such as the title of the assignment and the date and time of the submission.

### Others

By using the UTOL's LINE notification, there is a possibility that LINE Corp. may acquire and use the status of your usage of LINE, since you periodically receive LINE messages from the University's information system called UTOL.

## Note

We will shortly provide a separate detailed instructions on how to set up the LINE notification function.
