<div style="text-align: right;">December 27, 2024</div>

The utelecon portal site has provided a variety of information on using ICT at the University of Tokyo. We would like to announce that we have introduced two new ways for users to access the latest information posted on utelecon easily. We would also like to take this time to introduce a similar existing tool that makes it easier to access the latest information.

## We will start providing RSS (really simple syndication)

The latest information published in [the “Notice” section](/en/#notice) of the top page of utelecon is distributed as an RSS feed. RSS is a method for distributing new information on websites. By subscribing to this RSS feed, you can quickly and easily receive the latest information on the “Notice”. For details on how to use it, please see [the explanation page for RSS](/en/notice/rss).

Please note that not all updates to the portal site are distributed via RSS. You can check the latest information on pages other than “Notice” by referring to them as needed.

## We will start sharing information on SNS (social networking service)

We will also share the latest information posted on the utelecon portal site via our official X (formerly Twitter) accounts. In addition to the content of the “Notice” section, we will also introduce new and important articles from utelecon, and we plan to deliver information on major system failures at the University of Tokyo as needed. Please follow the account and check the latest information in a timely manner.

- [uteleconお知らせ](https://x.com/utelecon_pr) (in Japanese)
- [utelecon notice](https://x.com/utelecon_pr_en) (in English)

Note that this account does not respond to inquiries from users. If you need a reply, please contact us using [the email form on the support desk page](/en/support/#email-form). For other detailed usage policies, please refer to the [“utelecon Social Media Policy”](/en/docs/sns-policy).

In addition, you can also follow this account and turn on notifications for new posts from this account to find out about the latest posts immediately. Please make use of these functions as well.

## We are sending out emails about “System Failures and Maintenance Information”

Since August 2023, utelecon has been providing [a page where you can view a list of system failures and maintenance information](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/utokyoaccount/SitePages/en/service-status.aspx) (sign-in with your UTokyo Account is required) (cf. “[「システムの障害・メンテナンス情報」ページ作成のお知らせ](/notice/2023/08-service-status),” only in Japanese). In addition, we are also sending out emails about the information on this page to ECCS Cloud Email using Google Groups. If you would like to receive notifications by email, please log in to ECCS Cloud Email and click the “Join Group” button on the “System Outages and Maintenance Information” group page to register.
