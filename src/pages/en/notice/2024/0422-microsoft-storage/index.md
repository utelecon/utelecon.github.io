\* This English edition is a brief summary. For full information, please see [the Japanese version](/notice/2024/0422-microsoft-storage/). We apologize for the inconvenience.

Changes made by Microsoft to the Microsoft 365 for Education specifications will reduce the cloud storage capacity available for UTokyo as a whole. As a result, the maximum OneDrive storage capacity allocated to individual members of UTokyo has to be reduced.

For students and employed faculty/staff, the capacity limit is planned to be reduced to 50 GB on 1 August 2024. If you have more than 50 GB of files in your OneDrive, you will be unable to add or edit files after this date.  
Please note that you cannot expand your OneDrive capacity. If you need more storage, consider using other storage services provided. More information is available in [the Japanese version of this notice](/notice/2024/0422-microsoft-storage/). 

In addition, the other UTokyo Account holders (e.g., visiting faculty members etc. who do not have employment relationships) had their storage capacities reduced to 100 GB as of 1 February 2024, before those mentioned above. Their capacities are also planned to be reduced to 50 GB on 1 August 2024.
