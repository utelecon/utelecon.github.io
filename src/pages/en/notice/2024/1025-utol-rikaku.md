## Course Confirmation Date for the A Semester

The Learning Management System “UTOL” (UTokyo LMS) sets a deadline (hereafter referred to as the "**course confirmation date**") for students to gain access to courses as enrolled students by registering the relevant courses through the UTAS syllabus favorites listing or by self-registration in UTOL.

In the S semester, the course confirmation date was set as the final day of the course registration or course correction period for the Faculty or Graduate School offering the relevant courses. However, for the A Semester of the 2024 Academic Year, it has been uniformly set as follows.

| Term | College of Arts and Sciences Junior Division | Other than Junior Division |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| A1 Term/A semester | **October 17** | **October 31** |
| A2 Term | **October 17** | **December 18** |
| W Term | (No courses offered) | **February 15, 2025** |

We believe that the operational issues encountered in the S semester such as "being locked out of courses I plan to register for and subsequently losing access to course materials or assignments before the registration period started", can be avoided to some extent in the A semester.

However, personal issues such as mistakenly believing that you are already registered in UTAS because you can access the course may occur. Students are strongly reminded to **complete their course registration through UTAS during the period specified by their affiliated faculty or graduate school. Please note that access to courses in UTOL does not necessarily mean that registration in UTAS has been completed.**

If you have any questions concerning UTOL, please contact us through the [Support Desk](/en/support/). If you have any questions concerning your registration through UTAS, please contact with the academic affairs office of your affiliation.

## Supplementary Information

### 1. Courses for College of Arts and Sciences Junior Division

The course confirmation date for the courses offered by the Junior Division of the College of Arts and Sciences is **Thursday, October 17, 2024**.

"If you can no longer access the course because you forgot to register during the registration period", please make sure to complete your registration during the course correction period. Please note that **the course confirmation date for courses shared with merged courses offered by the Senior Division of the College of Arts and Sciences is October 31 for the A1 Term and A Semester, and December 18 for the A2 Term**. Be sure you do not forget to register for your courses during the course registration period.

### 2. Changes in the state of taking courses

Courses in the A1 term will be used as an example.

#### 2.1 Taking the course

As of October 25, courses for the A1 Term are available on UTOL, and you can access them by adding them to your favorites in the UTAS syllabus listing or by self-registration in UTOL. In the timetable on UTOL, "(**Favorite Registration**)" or "(**Self-Registration**)" will be displayed next to "Enrolled Student" for each course.

When you register for courses through UTAS after the course registration period begins, "(**Enrolled Registration**)" will be displayed in the timetable on UTOL.

Please note that information on adding courses to your favorites in the UTAS syllabus listing or registering for courses will be extracted from UTAS early each morning, and reflected in UTOL later that same morning. As a result, changes made in UTAS are generally reflected in UTOL the following morning.

#### 2.2 “Favorite Registration” is unavailable

You will no longer be able to access courses using the "(Favorite Registration)" starting from the morning after the end of the course registration period or the course correction period.

As you may already know, the course registration period and course correction period vary depending on your affiliation or year of study. Consequently, the date when the "(Favorite Registration)" becomes unavailable differs for each student. However, with a few exceptions, it is expected to be before October 31.

#### 2.3 “Self-Registration” is unavailable

**You will no longer be able to access courses using "(Self-Registration)" starting from early in the morning of Friday, November 1, following the October 31 course confirmation date for the A1 Term.** However, you may still be able to access the course if the instructor changes the settings for the relevant course.

### 3. Auditing

We hear from students who for one reason or other "do not wish to or cannot officially register courses through UTAS but wish to audit the courses".

It is up to the instructors to decide whether or not to allow such students to audit. Please contact the instructor directly to discuss this matter.

If there are only a few students auditing, the registration method will be the (**Registered by Instructor**). If there are many students auditing, the instructor can change the course settings to allow access. If the instructors do not know the specific procedures, please refer to the following web pages.

* If there are only a few students auditing: "[Managing Course Participants on UTOL (Confirmation, Registration, etc.) (for Course Instructors・TAs) > Update the registration method for course participants](/en/utol/lecturers/settings/course_participants/#update)".
* If there are many students auditing: "[Configuring Course Settings in UTokyo LMS (UTOL, for Course Instructors/TAs > Self-Registration and Student Range Settings](/en/utol/lecturers/settings/)".

    - In the course settings, please tick “**Always all regardless of registration method" for "the enrolled student range settings", furthermore make sure to set "Self-Registration" to "Permit".**

### 4. There are course settings that differ from regular settings

Due to the circumstances of the course instructors, some courses may be accessible only to students who have registered for them through UTAS, even before the course confirmation date. Please contact the instructor directly for further clarification.
