When using the UTOL’s attendance management function, students may not see the “submit attendance” screen for each course even if the attendance management settings (“Student self registration”, “Available date and time for submission”, “Late time setting”, and ”One-time Password”) are configured for each weekly course. The “submit attendance” screen for each course can be displayed to students after the course instructors configure the prescribed settings.

Based on the information of each course registered automatically, which is linked to UTAS (hereinafter referred to as “class session”), and the information of courses configured in the “class session management” and “classes” of the attendance management function will be automatically registered.

Class sessions registered automatically cannot be renamed or deleted. In addition, the “submit attendance” screen is not displayed as a default setting to enrolled students. Even if you configure the attendance management in each class session, the “submit attendance” screen will not be displayed to enrolled students. The course settings can be configured on UTOL to display the “submit attendance” screen to enrolled students. For courses registered manually without using the class session function of the UTOL, you can register any name for these courses. In addition, the “submit attendance” screen for the courses registered manually will be displayed to enrolled students regardless of the course setting.

## How to address the issue

### For students

Please notify your course instructors that the “submit attendance” screen is not displayed on UTOL.

### For course instructors

When a student inquiries about, “the “submit attendance” screen not being displayed on UTOL” for your course, please configure the following settings.

- Select “Course settings>Course settings” from the left side menu, then check the box for “Display attendance information automatically registered from classes management to enrolled student.”

For more details on settings to use the attendance function, please refer to [“UTOLで出席機能を利用する（教員・TA 向け）(“Using attendance management on UTOL (for course instructors/TAs)” - currently available only in Japanese)](/utol/lecturers/attendances/)

To avoid putting any students at a disadvantages, we would appreciate it you could handle with special care those students whose “submit attendance” screen was not displayed and/or those who could not register their attendance due to the above described settings.

## Request for Cooperation

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and trouble this may cause to course instructors, students, and staff members associated with academic affairs. Thank you for your cooperation.
