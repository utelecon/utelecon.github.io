-- If you have not activated multi-factor authentication on your UTokyo Account, you will not be able to sign in to the UTokyo Wi-Fi account menu and therefore can not be issued a UTokyo Wi-Fi account. Before you can get a UTokyo Wi-Fi account for AY 2024 issued, you must activate multi-factor authentication for your UTokyo Account.
Activating multi-factor authentication on UTokyo Account was not a requirement for issuing accounts for AY 2023, but is now mandatory for accounts for AY 2024.

-- If you have not completed the AY 2024 information security education course, you will not be able to sign in to the UTokyo Wi-Fi account menu after 1 March 2024 and therefore can not be issued a UTokyo Wi-Fi account. It is not sufficient to complete the course before the end of the course period, but it is necessary to complete the course before getting an account issued.
