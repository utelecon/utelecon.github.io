title: System Changes to the Authentication Infrastructure of UTokyo Account
---

On 12 March 2024 (scheduled), several system changes will be applied to the authentication infrastructure of UTokyo Account. These changes are intended to make multi-factor authentication, which becomes mandatory for UTokyo Account, more convenient to use. For more information on the mandatory use of multi-factor authentication, please refer to "[Multi-Factor Authentication is Mandatory for UTokyo Account](/en/notice/2024/mfa100-schedule)”.

## More information systems will require `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp` when signing in
{:#require-utac}

When signing in to your UTokyo Account, the 1st screen below used to appear and you could sign in with your 10-digit common ID and password, omitting `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp` in some cases. After this system change, more often the 2nd screen below will appear and you will be required to enter your “10-digit common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`”.

※ The 2nd screen is one that has ever been appeared, but the background image and layout will be changed on this occasion.

This change applies to information systems marked with “○” in the [UTokyo Account Service Directory](https://login.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utokyoaccount/ ) (in Japanese). Typical examples are as follows:

- UTAS
- UTOL
- Zoom
- ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)
- UTokyo MyOPAC
- EZproxy

Please understand that this change is necessary to make passwordless sign-in widely available, which is explained next.

## Passwordless sign-in will be widely available
{:#passwordless-sign-in}

Passwordless sign-in is signing into a system without entering a password. With this system change, passwordless sign-in will be available in many cases.

This change applies to information systems marked with “○” in the [UTokyo Account Service Directory](https://login.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utokyoaccount/). Typical examples are as follows:

- UTAS
- UTOL
- Zoom
- ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)
- UTokyo MyOPAC
- EZproxy

There are two passwordless sign-in methods available for UTokyo Account: FIDO security key and Microsoft Authenticator. Each of these methods is described below.

Please note that these passwordless sign-in methods do not require other methods of identity verification, as they alone constitute multi-factor authentication.

### Using passwordless sign-in with a FIDO security key
{:#using-fido}

If you are using a FIDO Security Key as your verification method for UTokyo Account's multi-factor authentication, you can use passwordless sign-in with a FIDO Security Key. Please refer to [the FIDO Security Key Initial Settings](/utokyo_account/mfa/fido-security_key/) (in Japanese) for information on how to set up the initial settings and the available OS and browsers.

The sign-in process proceeds as follows:

1. When the sign-in screen appears, press “Sign-in options”.
2. When multiple options are displayed, select “Sign in with security key”.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your PIN, complete biometric authentication or tap the security key, then sign-in is complete.
   - If you are prompted to select an account, select UTokyo Account.

### Using passwordless sign-in with Microsoft Authenticator
{:#microsoft-authenticator}

If you are using Microsoft Authenticator as your UTokyo Account's multi-factor authentication method, you can use passwordless sign-in with Microsoft Authenticator by making an additional setting.

The setting procedure is as follows:

1. If you have not registered Microsoft Authenticator as your identification method, follow the “[Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial/)” to register Microsoft Authenticator as your identification method.
2. Launch the Microsoft Authenticator app on your smartphone and select your UTokyo Account displayed on the app.
3. Press “Enable phone sign-in.”
4. Press “Continue.”
5. Follow the instructions to sign in.
6. When you see the message “Please help us keep your device secure,” press “Register.” This completes the setup. 

The sign-in process proceeds as follows:

1. When the sign-in screen appears, enter your “10-digit common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`”.
2. Enter the displayed numbers into the Microsoft Authenticator app.
3. Sign-in is complete.

## FIDO security keys will be supported in all information systems that support multi-factor authentication
{:#fido-in-all}

Until now, some systems that support multi-factor authentication did not support FIDO security keys. After this system change, FIDO security keys can be used in all information systems that support multi-factor authentication. The following are examples of information systems that will newly support FIDO security keys.

- UTokyo MyOPAC
- EZproxy
- Business Travel Expense System
- Academic Access Management Federation (GakuNin)
