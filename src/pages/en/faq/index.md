## Questions regarding classes in general

### Q. How do I take attendance?
Some options for taking attendance are:
* Use [the attendance feature in UTOL](/en/utol/lecturers/attendances/)
* Answer online questionnaires such as Google Forms or Microsoft Forms
* To avoid fake attendance, require students to answer questions related to the contents of lecture or give feedback on the class.
* To avoid faking attendance, enable the “Collect emails” function when creating Google forms with ECCS Cloud Email account (UTokyo G Suite). Students’ email addresses would be collected for identity confirmation, making it harder for students to fake attendance. To do this, go to “Settings (the gear icon)”, check the box next to "Collect emails" and select “Restrict to users of UTokyo ECCS Cloud Email and its trusted organizations”.
* Call the roll (suitable for smaller size classes using web conference systems). You might have the participants turn on cameras and confirm their identities.
* Use the Zoom Webinar Report; You can use the Webinar Report’s participant join time and exit time information for attendance taking. Details can be found at <a href="/en/zoom/how/faculty_members/attendance/" target="_blank"> Zoom for staff: Managing Attendance</a>.

### Q. What should I do if I cannot join an online class?
* Please consult the following link “[How to join an online class](/en/oc/join/)”. It contains information on how to search for online class URLs, common problems, and where to contact when you cannot join a class.

## ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)
### Q. What is ECCS Cloud Email?
A.
* Simply put, it is UTokyo’s version of Google’s email service.
* As ECCS Cloud Email works as a Google account, you can use Google tools and services such as
* Google Drive (file storage service)
* Google Docs (word processor)
* Google Sheets (spreadsheet program)
* Google Forms (survey administration software)
* YouTube

For more information, please refer to [“ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)”](/en/google/)


### Q. How can I start using ECCS Cloud Email?
* Please read “Initial Setup Procedures” on the [“ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)”](/en/google/)

### Q. I cannot access Google Drive and files exclusive to UTokyo. What can I do?
* (On PC or smartphone) If you are taken to the “You need access” page, and it shows you are signed in with an email address other than your `@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` email address:
* You are already signed into Google with a different email address. To switch to your ECCS Cloud Email, click on the email address under “You’re signed in as”. After you are taken to the “Choose an account” page, select your ECCS Cloud Email address (`xxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`). If your ECCS Cloud Email address does not appear in the choices, click on “Use another account” and enter your ECCS Cloud Email address to sign in.

* (On your smartphone) If you are taken to pages showing “You need permission” or “Request access”:
  * This can happen when you are already signed in with another Google account. Follow the procedures below, and try accessing the drive/file again.
    1. Open a Google App such as Gmail, and press the icon in the upper right corner (either your own icon, or a human symbol if you have not set one up).
    2. Tap "Add another account" to add your Google account.
    3. You will be prompted to enter your email address and password, so enter your ECCS Cloud Email email address and password that you set up above.

### Q. I forgot my password / I cannot change my password. What can I do?

* See [ECCS Cloud Email – “Initial Setup Procedures”](/en/google/#initial-setup-procedures), and follow the instructions in “Task: Set your password and email address”.

### Q. What is the difference among `10-digits-ID@utac`, `10-digits-ID@g.ecc`, and `xxxx@g.ecc` (email address named after your choice) email addresses?
* `10-digits-ID@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`(e.g. `1234567890@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`)
  * Although it resembles an email address, it cannot be used for sending emails. However, the system may still send notifications or other messages to this address. For instance, regarding Zoom or UTokyo Slack, system-generated emails sent to this address can be received in each individual’s mailbox of ECCS Cloud Email.
  * This is used as your user name when you sign in to the system with your UTokyo Account. The 10-digit number before @ is called the common ID, and some systems require only this common ID to sign in.
* `10-digits-ID@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`(e.g. `1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`)
  * For those who newly enrolled or appointed after March 2024: This email address can be used as it is as an email address if you do not set up the ECCS Cloud Email initially. If you don’t set up a specific email address, you will use this address to log into Google. If you set up an email address later and change it to `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, you will need to use this newly set up email address to log into Google. Please note that even after changing the email address, emails sent to `10-digits-ID@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` will be delivered to `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.
  * For those who enrolled or appointed before February 2024: This is the ‘alias’ of ECCS Cloud Email. You cannot log in by entering this on Google’s login screen. Emails sent to this address will go to your ECCS Cloud Email mailbox. You can check this by logging into Gmail at `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.
* `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` (email address named after your choice)
  * The string preceding the ‘@’ is something you set yourself in the UTokyo Account user menu. You can log into Google services like Gmail with this email address. However, depending on when you enrolled or appointed, there are differences. For those who enrolled or appointed before February 2024, a certain `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` is set from the beginning, so if you don’t set it yourself, you will use it as an `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`. On the other hand, for those who enrolled or appointed after March 2024, a `10-digit-ID@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` is set initially, so unless you set the string yourself, you cannot use an email address in the form of `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.

## Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365)
### Q. I cannot sign into Microsoft Office. What can I do?
* ** If you see “That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one.” on the “Sign In” page**: Enter your `10-digit ID@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp` for user ID. Your 10-digit number is your 10-digit common ID.

### Q. I cannot edit after signing in. What can I do?
* There may be issues with license authentication. In such cases, editing might not be possible in Office applications such as Word.
* For Mac users: Please follow the instructions below to delete your Office License and retry license authentication.
  1. Follow the steps in [How to remove Office license files on a Mac – Office support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-remove-office-license-files-on-a-mac-b032c0f6-a431-4dad-83a9-6b727c03b193?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) to download the Microsoft license removal tool.
  2. When you open Office applications such as Word after deleting the license, you will be asked to sign into Microsoft 365 (if you are not asked to sign in, find and click the button which says “Sign In”). Please try to sign in with your UTokyo Account (10-digit ID@@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp) again.
  3. Once you have signed in, your license will be authenticated automatically.
* For other OS users: Please contact the support desk.

#### Q. Can I extend breakout time after the breakout session has started?
To be able to extend your breakout time, select the “Notify me when time is up” option when you create the breakout session. Once the session time is over, you will receive a notification. Select “keep breakout rooms open” to extend session time.

#### Q. Is there an effective way to sort students on the participant list to make grouping easier for breakout sessions?
A. Sorting students on the participant list can be done easily by changing the students’ “Display name”. During the Zoom meeting, ask your students to add numbers or discussion topics to the beginning of their “Display name” (e.g. “01 Smith”, “ Topicxxx Smith”). The students with the same number/discussion topic will show together on the participant list, making it easier to assign them to the same group.


#### Q. Can the co-host create a breakout room?
A. Yes, the co-host can create a breakout room for December 2020 version 5.4.6 or higher. Please try updating your Zoom App if the feature is not enabled.
