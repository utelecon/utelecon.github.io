    <summary>Troubleshooting guide: When the error message “You don’t have access to this” appears</summary>
    There is a possibility that the application for <a href="/utokyo_account/mfa/">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> of your UTokyo Account, which is required to use UTokyo VPN, has not been completed. Please make sure to follow the initial setup procedure on the page, “<strong><a href="/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial">Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts</a></strong>” <strong>until the last step, “Step 4: Apply for MFA Use”</strong> to enable multi-factor authentication for your UTokyo Account. It will take about <strong>40 minutes</strong> for the MFA settings to be reflected in the system after these procedures, so please wait for a while.
