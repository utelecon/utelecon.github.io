## Introduction
{:#introduction}

UTokyo VPN is a VPN service available to all the faculties and staff of the University of Tokyo (UTokyo). When a device is connected to the UTokyo VPN from outside the campus, the device communicates via the VPN gateway installed at the Information Technology Center. Thereafter, the device virtually connects to the UTNET - UTokyo campus network.

To use UTokyo VPN, first install AnyConnect, a VPN client application, on your device. When the installed application is launched, it connects to the VPN gateway through the UTokyo Account authentication process, allowing communication from the device to the outside world through UTNET via VPN.

### Access to e-journals
