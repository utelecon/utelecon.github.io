You are now ready to use VPN.

Note: After installing the AnyConnect client application on a macOS 11 Big Sur or later, three extensions with the name “Cisco AnyConnect Socket Filter” are added to the “Network” in the “System Preferences”. These extensions are necessary for shifting networks between VPN and others such as Wi-Fi or LAN. They do not record the contents of communications or send the information outside the host. These extensions' statuses are always “connected (green dot)” regardless of a real connection to the UTokyo VPN.
