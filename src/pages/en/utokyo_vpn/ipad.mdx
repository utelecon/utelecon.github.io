## Usage: Connecting to the UTokyo VPN

The following procedure is required each time you use the VPN. Please note that the VPN connection is not automatically established immediately after the device is turned on.


**Step E:** Confirm that “vpn1.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp” is listed in the “Connections” column at the upper left of the screen as shown in the first image below.

**Step G:** Your device is connected to the UTokyo VPN if the "Details" screen shows "Connected" as shown below.
