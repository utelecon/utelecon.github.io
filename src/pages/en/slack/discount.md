*This page is a guide to the procedures for making individually paid subscriptions to Slack. 
Please see the [UTokyo Slack page](.) for information on the university-wide subscription of the University of Tokyo.

## Overview

[Slack](https://slack.com/) offers an 85% discount on paid plans (Pro or “Business+” plans) under the ["Slack for Education" program](https://slack.com/help/articles/206646877).

Normally, applicants for this program are required to submit documents to prove that they are from an educational institution for each application, but the University of Tokyo, in consultation with Slack, has established a procedure that does not require such proof each time.

In this specific procedure, your applications are received internally by the University of Tokyo which is then submitteds to Slack. Please note that this procedure is different from the normal application procedure.
