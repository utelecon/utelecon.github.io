This page describes the procedure for joining UTokyo Slack by receiving an invitation from a specific workspace. The procedures differ depending on whether you are already using UTokyo Slack or have just started using UTokyo Slack. 

## If you are already using UTokyo Slack

If you are already using UTokyo Slack, you will receive a direct message from the Slackbot in the UTokyo Slack workspace you are currently in. This message contains a link to the workspace, which will take you to the workspace you have been invited to.

## If you have just started using UTokyo Slack

### Before you join

<Before />

### Procedure

1. Once the invitation is made by the person in charge of the workspace, you will receive an invitation email in your [ECCS Cloud Email](/en/eccs_cloud_email).<small style="display: block;">* We ask the person in charge to enter a 10-digit Common ID followed by <code>@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>, which indicates that you are a member of UTokyo, (e.g. `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) as the email address when sending invitations. Since emails sent to this email address will be forwarded to the ECCS Cloud Email <code>@<em>g.ecc</em>.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>, you can receive the invitation email by logging in to ECCS Cloud Email.</small>
1. Click on the "Sign in with UTokyo Account" button in the email.
1. Unless you have already signed in to your UTokyo Account, the sign-in page will be displayed. Please sign in.
