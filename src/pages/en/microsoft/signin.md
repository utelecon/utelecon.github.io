## Sign in to Microsoft systems
{:#instruction}

This section explains how to sign in using your UTokyo Account if a screen appears requesting you to sign in to the Microsoft system.

In that case, please follow the steps below to sign in. On the other hand, if the screen is not as shown below but a normal sign-in screen (with a picture of Yasuda Auditorium) is displayed, please sign in following "[Sign in to the ICT systems with your UTokyo Account](/en/utokyo_account/#signin)."

If the above steps do not work, please try the methods "[using incognito browsing](#secret_browsing)" or "[using multiple profiles](#profiles)" described in "[Using multiple Microsoft accounts in the same browser](#multiple_accounts)."

## Using multiple Microsoft accounts in the same browser
{:#multiple_accounts}

If you have been given two UTokyo Accounts, one for students and one for faculty and staff, or if you have a personal or organizational Microsoft account in addition to your UTokyo Account, using multiple Microsoft accounts in the same browser may cause account switching to not function properly.

Instead of using a different browser for each Microsoft account to avoid this issue, you can use multiple Microsoft accounts in the same browser by using the browser's incognito browsing function or using multiple profiles.

### Using incognito browsing
{:#secret_browsing}

If you want to temporarily use a different Microsoft account, it is convenient to use the incognito browsing function of your browser.

Incognito browsing is a function that allows you to use the browser without having the browser remember information such as browsing history or sign-in information. While using the incognito browsing function, not only is no information remembered, but the browser is also unaffected by information that is remembered when you normally use the browser. In other words, in incognito browsing, you can view web pages without being affected by the sign-in information stored in the browser. Therefore, if you sign in to a Microsoft account using the incognito browsing function, you can use the Microsoft system without being affected by the other Microsoft accounts you normally sign in to.

Note that the incognito browsing method is only suitable if you want to temporarily sign in with a different account. This is because the information of the signed-in account is deleted from the browser after closing the browser window. If you use a Microsoft account frequently and want to use it continuously, the "[Use multiple profiles](#profiles)" method described below is convenient.

The name of the incognito browsing feature and the procedure for using it vary depending on the browser. For details, please refer to the official documentation for each browser listed below.

- **Google Chrome**：[Browse in Incognito mode](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en)
- **Safari**：[Browse privately in Safari on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/browse-privately-ibrw1069/mac)
- **Microsoft Edge**：[Browse InPrivate in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/browse-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge-cd2c9a48-0bc4-b98e-5e46-ac40c84e27e2)
- **Firefox**：[Private Browsing - Use Firefox without saving history](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history)

### Using multiple profiles
{:#profiles}

If you want to use different Microsoft accounts on an ongoing basis, it is convenient to use multiple profiles in the same browser.

A profile is a function that allows you to store multiple pieces of information (bookmarks, history, passwords, etc.) set and stored in the browser in parallel. Using multiple profiles allows you to sign in to different Microsoft accounts for each profile, and the signed-in state for each profile is maintained even when the window is closed, making it ideal for using different Microsoft accounts on an ongoing basis.

The procedure for creating a profile varies depending on the browser. For details, please refer to the official documentation for each browser listed below.
