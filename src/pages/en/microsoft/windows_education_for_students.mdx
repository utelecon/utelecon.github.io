## Overview

**Students** at the University of Tokyo can obtain a license to upgrade Windows 10 or Windows 11 to the Education edition. This license is provided as part of the [UTokyo Microsoft License](../).

### Scope of use and directions

- The target is a **privately owned PC**, and only one PC can be applied.
    - Please note that it cannot be used on PCs owned by the university, etc.
- You can continue to use the upgraded PC even after you leave the university due to graduation, etc.
    - No uninstallation is required.
- Only students can use it. Please understand that **faculty and staff cannot use it**.
- This is a license for upgrading, not for clean installation. Please be careful.
