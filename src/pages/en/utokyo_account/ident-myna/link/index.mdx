## Introduction
This page explains the "pre-link process" that you need to complete before using the UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service.

The overall process is as follows:

- Step 1: [Setting up the digital identification app](#app-setup)
- Step 2: [Verify your identity using the app and your My Number Card](#auth)
- Step 3: [Sign in with your UTokyo Account to complete pre-linking ](#signin)
- Step 4: [Confirm the link status](#statuscheck)

When accessing the UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service, the procedure in Step 2 differs depending on whether you use a PC (together with a smartphone) or only a smartphone. We recommend completing the process using only a smartphone, as the procedure is more straightforward.

## What you need

- Your physical [My Number Card (Individual Number Card of Japan)](https://www.digital.go.jp/en/policies/mynumber) [^1]
- The 4-digit PIN (Personal Identification Number) you registered when you received your My Number Card. ([Electronic Certificate of User Proof (in Japanese)](https://faq.myna.go.jp/faq/show/3494), [PIN for Card Info Input Support (in Japanese)](https://faq.myna.go.jp/faq/show/2385)) [^2]
- A smartphone that can use the digital identification app (iOS 16.0 or later, or Android 11 or later) [^3]
- A PC, if you perform the procedure from a PC (you can also complete the entire procedure on a smartphone)

[^1]: The so-called ["Smartphone My Number Card"](https://www.digital.go.jp/en/policies/mynumber/smartphone-certification) (e.g., electronic certification for smartphones on Androids or iPhone My Number Card) is no longer available as of September 2025.
[^2]: If you have forgotten your PIN or it has been locked, you need to go to the office of the municipality where you are registered to have it initialized and reset. For details, please check the [My Number Card General Portal Site FAQ](https://www.kojinbango-card.go.jp/en-faq/#kojinbango) "Q10 I do not know the PIN for my Individual Number Card. What should I do?".
[^3]: The devices listed in the "マイナンバーカードに対応したスマートフォン一覧" (List of Smartphones Compatible with My Number Card) file on the page linked from the [JPKI (Japan Public Key Infrastructure) Portal Site (in Japanese)](https://www.jpki.go.jp/prepare/reader_writer.html) can be used.

## Step 1: Setting up the digital identification app
{:#app-setup}
First, please set up the digital identification app.

1. Install the "Digital Identification App" onto your smartphone from the following links.
    - [Link for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/id6454900894?l=en-US)
    - [Link for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.go.digital.auth_and_sign)
1. Complete the user registration for the app by following the [registration method published on the Digital Agency of Japan's official website.](https://services.digital.go.jp/en/auth-and-sign/start-guide/).

## Step 2: Perform identity verification using the app and your My Number Card
{:#auth}

Next, verify your identity using your My Number Card and the Digital Identification App.  The steps differ slightly depending on whether you complete the verification **[using only a smartphone] (#auth-smartphone)**or **[use both a PC and a smartphone] (#auth-pc)**. The method is simpler if you only use a smartphone. Please follow the steps applicable to your situation.
