title: Pre-linking the UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service
---

## Introduction
This page explains the "pre-link" procedure, which must be completed in advance to use the UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service.

The overall process is as follows:

- Step 1: [Set up the digital identification app](#app-setup)
- Step 2: [Perform identity verification using the app and your My Number Card](#auth)
- Step 3: [Sign in with your UTokyo Account and make the link](#signin)
- Step 4: [Confirm the link status](#statuscheck)

When accessing the UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service, the procedure in Step 2 differs depending on whether you use a PC (in case of using both a PC and a smartphone) or not (in case of using only a smartphone). We recommend completing the process using only a smartphone, as the procedure is more straightforward.

## What you need

- Your physical [My Number Card (Individual Number Card of Japan)](https://www.digital.go.jp/en/policies/mynumber) [^1]
- The 4-digit PIN (Personal Identification Number) you registered when you received your My Number Card.（[Electronic Certificate of User Proof(in Japanese)](https://faq.myna.go.jp/faq/show/3494)，[PIN for Card Info Input Support(in Japanese)](https://faq.myna.go.jp/faq/show/2385)）[^2]
- A smartphone that can use the digital identification app (iOS 16.0 or later, or Android 11 or later) [^3]
- A PC, if you perform the procedure from a PC (you can also complete the entire procedure on a smartphone)

[^1]: As of September 2025, the so-called [“Smartphone My Number Card"](https://www.digital.go.jp/en/policies/mynumber/smartphone-certification) (e.g., electronic certification for smartphones on Androids  or iPhone My Number Card) is not available.
[^2]: If you have forgotten your PIN or it has been locked, you need to go to the office of the municipality where you are registered to have it initialized and reset. For details, please check the [My Number Card General Portal Site(in Japanese)](https://www.kojinbango-card.go.jp/faq_pin3/).
[^3]:The device must be listed in the "List of Smartphones Compatible with My Number Card" file on the page linked from the [JPKI (Japan Public Key Infrastructure) Portal Site(in Japanese)](https://www.jpki.go.jp/prepare/reader_writer.html).

## Step 1: Set up the digital identification app
{:#app-setup}
First, please set up the digital identification app.

1. Install the “Digital Identification App”.
    - [Link for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/id6454900894)
    - [Link for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.go.digital.auth_and_sign)
1. Complete the user registration for the app by following the [registration method published by the Digital Agency.](https://services.digital.go.jp/auth-and-sign/start-guide/).

## Step 2: Perform identity verification using the app and your My Number Card
{:#auth}

Use your My Number Card and the digital identification app to perform identity verification. The procedure is slightly different for **[the case of using only a smartphone](#auth-smartphone)** and **[the case of using both a PC and a smartphone](#auth-pc)**. It is easier to complete this process using only a smartphone. Please follow the steps applicable to your situation.
