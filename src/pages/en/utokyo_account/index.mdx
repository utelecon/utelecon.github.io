## What is UTokyo Account?
{:#about}

- **UTokyo Account** is a university-wide account that is required to use the ICT systems of the University of Tokyo. Students, faculty and staff of the University of Tokyo are required to sign in with this account to use various ICT systems.
  - Even if you do not currently have an account, you can receive a UTokyo Account if you are a member of an organization that has been accepted and managed by the university. If you wish to obtain an account, please contact the relevant office of your department (students should contact the academic office, and faculty and staff members should contact the personnel department).
- The username of UTokyo Account is represented by a 10-digit number and is also called the **“Common ID”**. In the ICT systems, a 10-digit Common ID followed by `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, which indicates that you are a member of the University of Tokyo, is sometimes used, such as `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.
  - The "10-digit Common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`" is not an email address that can be used normally.
  - System notification emails sent to "10-digit Common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`" may be forwarded to [the ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)](/en/google/), but you cannot send emails using "10-digit Common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`".
- For more information on the services available through the UTokyo Account, please see the **[UTokyo Account Service Directory](https://login.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utokyoaccount/)** and [the "Systems of the University of Tokyo" page](/en/systems/).
  - The available systems differ depending on the user's enrollment status, affiliation, and so on, and not all systems are available to all users.

## Sign in to the ICT systems with your UTokyo Account
{:#signin}

This section explains how to sign in to various ICT systems using your UTokyo Account.

When using the ICT systems, if the following sign-in screen (with an image of Akamon Gate) appears, you need to sign in with your UTokyo Account. Please follow these steps to sign in:

![](img/signin-akamon.png){:.small.center.thin-border}
1. Enter "10-digit Common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`" in the input field, then click "Next."
1. When the screen shown in the bottom-left screenshot appears, enter your password and click "Sign in."
1. If the "Verify your identity" screen shown in the bottom-right screenshot or the "Approve sign in request" screen appears, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the multi-factor authentication.
1. You will be signed in and redirected to the system page you are trying to access.

<figure class="gallery">![](img/password-akamon.png){:.small.center.thin-border}![](img/mfa-akamon.png){:.small.center.thin-border}</figure>

Additionally, during sign-in, you may see a screen like the following. In this case, please select the item labeled "10-digit Common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`".

![](img/signin-select-account.png){:.small.center.thin-border}

Many of the ICT systems that allow users to sign in using their UTokyo Account are linked to each other, so that once a user has signed in with their username and password on one ICT system, the user does not subsequently need to enter the username and password to use another ICT system. This behavior is called **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

Specifically, it can be used in the following situations:

- When you need to retrieve cloud data after leaving the university (due to graduation, resignation, etc.) that you forgot to back up beforehand (i.e., when using the cloud data salvage service).
- When joining alumni services after graduation.

For more details, please refer to the [UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service page](./ident-myna/).
