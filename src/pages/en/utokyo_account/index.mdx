## What is UTokyo Account?
{:#about}

- **UTokyo Account** is a university-wide account that is required to use the ICT systems of the University of Tokyo. Students, faculty and staff of the University of Tokyo are required to sign in with this account to use various ICT systems.
  - Even if you do not currently have an account,  a UTokyo Account can be issued if necessary. If you wish to obtain an account, please contact the relevant office of your department (students should contact the academic office, and faculty and staff members should contact the personnel department).
- The username of UTokyo Account is represented by a 10-digit number and is also called the **“Common ID”**. In the ICT systems, a 10-digit Common ID followed by `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, which indicates that you are a member of the University of Tokyo, is sometimes used, such as `1234567890@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.
  - The "10-digit Common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`" is not an email address that can be used normally.
  - System notification emails sent to "10-digit common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`" may be forwarded to [the ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)](/en/google/), but you cannot send emails using "10-digit common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`".
- For more information on the services available through the UTokyo Account, please see the **[UTokyo Account Service Directory](https://login.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utokyoaccount/)** and [the "Systems of the University of Tokyo" page (in Japanese)](/systems).

## Sign in to the ICT systems with your UTokyo Account
{:#signin}

UTokyo Account provides access to a variety of ICT systems. The sign-in methods vary depending on the situation.

- When the following screen (with an image of Yasuda Auditorium) is displayed, you can sign in with your 10-digit Common ID and password.
![](img/signin-yasuda.png)
- If the image of Yasuda Auditorium does not appear and the sign-in screen appears as shown below, please enter "10-digit common ID + `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`".
    <figure class="gallery">
        <img src="img/signin-utac-01.png" />
        <img src="img/signin-utac-02.png" />
    </figure>

Many of the ICT systems that allow users to sign in using their UTokyo Account are linked to each other, so that once a user has signed in with their username and password on one ICT system, the user does not subsequently need to enter the username and password to use another ICT system. This behavior is called **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

## About passwords
{:#password}
### Validity period of a password
{:#password-expiration}

If you are using Multi-Factor Authentication, your password does not expire. Otherwise, your password is valid for 397 days (1 year + 1 month) after it is changed. The expiration date of the current password can be checked from [the User Menu](https://utacm.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/webmtn/LoginServlet).
*Before March 9, 2023, passwords were valid for 365 days regardless of whether or not Multi-Factor Authentication was enabled (see [this page](/en/notice/2023/03-utokyo_account-password) for details). Passwords set before March 9, 2023 will remain valid for 365 days and will not be extended, and passwords set after that date will have a new validity period.

A password is valid for one year after it is changed. The expiration date of your current password can be checked from the [User Menu](https://utacm.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/webmtn/LoginServlet).

### Changing passwords
{:#change-password}

You can change your password from the "Password Change" menu on the [User Menu](https://utacm.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/webmtn/LoginServlet). The password can be changed even if it has expired, so there is no need to reset or reissue a password.
