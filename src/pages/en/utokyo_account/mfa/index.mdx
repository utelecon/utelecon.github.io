When you change your phone model, please note that you can avoid being locked out from your UTokyo Account by registering your new phone for MFA (see [“Changing the Verification Method of Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts”](change/) for details) while your old phone is still available. Please make sure to complete this procedure in advance.
