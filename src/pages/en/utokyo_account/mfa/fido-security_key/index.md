## Introduction

This page explains how to use FIDO security keys for multi-factor authentication for UTokyo Accounts, including precautions, registration, and usage. FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is a new technology that is being promoted to improve the security when signing-in for online services. It is a sign-in method that does not share confidential information such as passwords and PINs with servers, thus reducing the risk of information leakage, while allowing a smooth operation without requiring the use of applications other than a browser. 

FIDO can be classified into two main types: one that uses a dedicated device called a security key, and another that uses a passkey using information stored on a PC or smartphone. However, the UTokyo Account's multi-factor authentication does not currently support FIDO passkeys, but only security keys such as YubiKey. Therefore, please purchase and use your own security key. Please note that the security keys that can be used are those compatible with the 'FIDO 2' standard

It is assumed that the FIDO security key will be registered as the second or subsequent verification method. If you are using the multi-factor authentication for the first time, please follow the procedure described in "[Step 1: Set Up the First Verification Method" in the "Initial Setup Procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication for UTokyo Accounts](/en/utokyo_account/mfa/initial/#first)"section, and then register a FIDO security key as the additional verification method.

1. Access the [Security info page](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info) and sign in.

*FIDO security keys cannot be set as the "default sign-in method". Therefore, for signing in, you must first set another verification method as the "default sign-in method" and then select the FIDO security key as the additional verification method.

## How to sign in with a FIDO security key

1. When signing into your UTokyo Account (and after entering your password), you will be prompted to verify your identification using the multi-factor authentication with the default verification method. Click on the "Sign in with a different method" or "I can’t use my Microsoft Authenticator app right now" link.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete actions such as entering a PIN, biometric authentication, or tapping the security key. After these steps, the sign-in process will be completed.

*If you have trouble signing in, please refer to "[If you cannot sign in using a FIDO security key](#unsupported-os-browser)".
