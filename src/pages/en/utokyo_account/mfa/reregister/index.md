This page describes the following procedures regarding [UTokyo Account Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](../): “**Reregistering Verification Method**” for MFA. 

In case you lose access to all verification methods and are unable to sign in to the UTokyo Account, we can take measures to allow you to retry the registration process for MFA all over again and keep using MFA. Check if any of your verification methods can be used beforehand as described below. Please follow the procedures only if all verification methods are no longer available.

For security reasons, UTokyo Account mandates the use of multi-factor authentication. If you have a compelling reason to use multi-factor authentication, please contact our [Support Desk](/en/support/email-form/).

The “Reregistering Verification Method” procedure was renamed from the “Resetting” procedure in September 2022.

## Step1: Check If Any Other Verification Methods Are Available

When one of your verification methods becomes unavailable due to malfunction, phone model change, etc., and alternative methods are still available, you can use one of them for verification.

Click the “Having trouble? Sign in another way” or “Use a different verification option” link in the verification screen that appears (after entering your password).

A list of verification methods that you have set up (including the default sign-in method) will be displayed.

- If any of the verification methods in the list are available for use, you can use that method to sign in to your UTokyo Account.
- If none of the methods in the list are available, you need to reregister your verification method for MFA. Please move on to the procedures below.

## Step2: Reregister the Verification Method

If none of the verification methods registered are available, reregister your verification method using the following procedures.

There are two ways to reregister: by using the Identity Verification Service or by submitting an application.

The Identity Verification Service allows you to reregister on your own. However, to use this service, you must meet several requirements, such as having alreay completed the pre-link for the ["UTokyo Account Identity Verification Service"](https://identification.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/verify/).
 - To reregister using the Identity Verification Service, please refer to "Reregister using the Identity Verification Service" and follow the procedure.

If you cannot use the Identity Verification Service, you will need to submit an application to reregister.
  - To reregister by application, please refer to "Reregister by Application" and follow the procedure.
