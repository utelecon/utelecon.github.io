#### Supplement
{:#create-profile-notes}
* Enter the user ID and password for the UTokyo account into the fields of “User-name” and “Password”. Note that they are not the regular ID and password for the UTokyo Account. You can check the user ID and password in the notification email described in the ”**Preparation**” step or the screen of the completed application.
* If there are any setting items other than mentioned above, please configure them as needed. If you have no particular preferences, you can leave the default settings.
* During the connecting operation, a screen asking if you trust the certificate may appear. To verify whether the certificate is correct, compare the "server fingerprint" of the displayed certificate with the fingerprint listed in 「[Connect Configuration](/utokyo_wifi/#connect-configuration)」. If they match, trust the certificate.
    * In addition, there are two types of fingerprints (SHA-1 and SHA-256) listed on [Connect Configuration](/utokyo_wifi/#connect-configuration);matching one type will suffice
