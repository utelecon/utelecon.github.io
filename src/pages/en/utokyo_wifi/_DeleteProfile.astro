If the screen for entering a { userIdField } and a password does not appear in Step 2 and it fails to connect to the Wi-Fi, you need to delete the existing setting and register a new one. This is necessary because although once you reissue your account and your previous account becomes invalid, your devices may still store it. Before using the new account, your devices must “forget” the previous one. There is no need to worry about never being able to connect to the UTokyo Wi-Fi again upon “deleting” a account.
