The beginning of the course will be notified (May for students and July for faculty and staff in the case of FY2022), so please be sure to take the course. **Failure to complete the course will result in suspension of your UTokyo Wi-Fi privileges until the end of that academic year, and you will not be able to connect to UTokyo Wi-Fi.** Once your account is suspended, you will not be able to log in to the account menu or create a new account.

UTokyo Wi-Fi is only available on individuals' own device: **it is prohibited to use UTokyo Wi-Fi on a shared device by more than one person.** Because it allows anyone other than the user who owns a UTokyo Wi-Fi Account to use the service, and it is considered to be lending of an account, which is prohibited by the Terms of Use. However, if the OS user account is set up separately for each individual, and the UTokyo Wi-Fi account can only be used by the person who has obtained it, UTokyo Wi-Fi is able to be used.

## Steps to start using the service

The specific method of the removal varies depending on the OS and device type, so please refer to the manual of the respective device.

Also, please refer to the [ECCS Tutor's Page](https://www.sodan.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/faq/utokyo-wifi-en/), which contains detailed connection instructions for each device as necessary.
- If you encounter problems on the second or subsequent connections, please refer to "[Account expiration date](#expiration)" on this page.
