### Information Security Education

At the University of Tokyo, we conduct information security education for everyone with a UTokyo Account each year. You will be notified when the implementation period arrives, so please ensure to pass the test. For details about the timing and the procedure of the course, kindly refer to the <a href="https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/en/Information_Security_Education.aspx">Information Security Education page</a>.

<details>
	<summary>If the course registration period has ended at the time of arrival or enrollment in the university</summary>
	In this case, your UTokyo Wi-Fi Account will not be suspended, and you will be able to use UTokyo Wi-Fi from the time of your arrival or enrollment. Please read carefully the "Information Security Education Materials" on the Information Security Education page before you start using UTokyo Wi-Fi. Information security education is provided every year, so please take the course from the next year onward.

</details>
<details>
	<summary>If you have failed to complete information security training by the prescribed time </summary>
  The UTokyo Wi-Fi account will be suspended for the current year, so basically you will not be able to use UTokyo Wi-Fi until the end of the fiscal year. For more information on thepeople who have not yet taken the course, please contact `jouhousecurity.adm__at__gs.mail.u-tokyo.ac.jp` (`__at__` transfer to @) with your UTokyo Account username (10-digit common ID).
</details>

### Using UTokyo Wi-Fi on Shared Devices

UTokyo Wi-Fi is only available on individuals' own device: **it is prohibited to use UTokyo Wi-Fi on a shared device by more than one person.** Because it allows anyone other than the user who owns a UTokyo Wi-Fi Account to use the service, and it is considered to be lending of an account, which is prohibited by the Terms of Use. However, if the OS user account is set up separately for each individual, and the UTokyo Wi-Fi account can only be used by the person who has obtained it, UTokyo Wi-Fi is able to be used.

## Steps to start using the service

{:#initial-setup}

<ul class="gap">
  <li>
    <strong>Step 1: Check the devices to be used </strong>

## Information on usage

### Account expiration date

{:#expiration}

UTokyo Wi-Fi accounts expire at the end of April of the following fiscal year. New accounts can be issued before the start of each fiscal year, so if you want to continue using UTokyo Wi-Fi, you need to reissue an account each fiscal year.

- The procedure for reissuing an account is the same as Steps 2 and 3 above.
  - If you have not taken the information security training course and your account has been suspended, you cannot reissue an account. Please refer to the "[Information Security Education](#jouhou-security)" section above for details.
- Once the account has been reissued, enter the user ID and password for the new account into the device you use and connect to it.
  - If the device remembers your previous UTokyo Wi-Fi account information and you are not able to change it (i.e., screen to enter a new user ID and password does not appear), please delete your Wi-Fi account information on the device. The specific method of the removal varies depending on the OS and device type, so please refer to the manual of the respective device. For Windows, please also refer to [ECCS Tutor's Page](https://www.sodan.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/faq/utokyo-wifi-win10-en/), and for iOS, please refer to the official help "[How to forget a Wi-Fi network on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208941)".

## Troubleshooting and Inquiries

If you encounter any problems when using the system, please check the following points first.

- If you are having problems connecting for the first time, carefully reread the "[Steps to start using the service](#initial-setup)" section of this page. Also, please refer to the [ECCS Tutor's Page](https://www.sodan.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/faq/utokyo-wifi-en/), which contains detailed connection instructions for each device as necessary.
- If you encounter problems on the second or subsequent connections, please refer to "[Account expiration date](#expiration)" on this page.
- Please consult with your friends, colleagues, and others around you who already succeeded in connecting.

If you still have trouble, please contact **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support)**. Please understand the following points when making inquiries.

- We receive many inquiries. In most cases, it is difficult to respond immediately.
- We cannot always provide support for a specific model because it is impractical to possess and test all types of equipment. Please consider contacting the distributor or manufacturer.
