## Information on usage

### Account expiration date

{:#expiration}

UTokyo Wi-Fi accounts expire at the early May of the following academic year. New accounts can be issued before the start of each academic year, so if you wish to continue using the service, you must reissue an account each academic year. For details on how to reissue an account, please refer to the "[Procedure for reissuing or re-setting up your account](#reissue-account)".

### If you suddenly lose Wi-Fi connection
{:#suddenly-cannot-connect}
If you suddenly lose connection to UTokyo Wi-Fi when it was working fine before, there may be a problem with your UTokyo Wi-Fi account. To check this, try signing in to the "[UTokyo Wi-Fi Account Menu](https://acm.wifi.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/secure/user_applies/index/1/)".

- If you receive the error message "申し訳ありませんが、サインイン中に問題が発生しました。" or "Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in." and you are unable to sign in, you may have not passed the confirmation test of the Information Security Education which is conducted annually. In this case, please attend the "[Information Security Education](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/en/Information_Security_Education.aspx)" first, pass the confirmation test, and then [reissue or re-set up your account](#reissue-account).
- If your UTokyo Wi-Fi account information, such as user ID and notification email address, is not displayed on the screen immediately after signing in, your account seems to have been deleted for some reason.  Please [reissue or re-set up your account](#reissue-account).
- The expiration date of your UTokyo Wi-Fi account will be displayed on the screen immediately after you sign in. If the expiration date has passed, please [reissue or re-set up your account](#reissue-account).

If none of the above applies, there appears to be nothing wrong with your UTokyo Wi-Fi account. It could be due to a temporary fault with UTokyo Wi-Fi or a malfunction with your device. Check the [UTokyo Wi-Fi troubleshooting page](https://www.sodan.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/faq/utokyo-wifi-trouble-shooting-en/).

If you still have trouble, please contact **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support)**. 

### Procedure for reissuing or re-setting up your account
{:#reissue-account}

In some cases, a previously used UTokyo Wi-Fi account may become invalid for some reason, such as expiry. In these cases, it is not sufficient to simply reissue an account from the UTokyo Wi-Fi Account Menu; you will need to set up the newly issued account on your device again. Follow the steps below.

1. Re-issue an account from the UTokyo Wi-Fi Account Menu according to step 2 of the "[Steps to start using the service](#initial-setup)".
    - If the error message "申し訳ありませんが、サインイン中に問題が発生しました。" or "Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in." appears, please take the "[Information Security Education](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/sites/Security/SitePages/en/Information_Security_Education.aspx)" and pass the confirmation test. To pass the confirmation test, you must answer all questions correctly.
2. Follow step 3 of "[Steps to start using the service](#initial-setup)" to re-set up your account on the device.
    - In some cases, the device may store your previous UTokyo Wi-Fi account information and not allow you to change it (i.e., the screen for entering a new user ID and password does not appear). In this case, please delete the UTokyo Wi-Fi account information. The specific procedure for deleting the information varies depending on the operating system and type of device, so refer to the manual of the respective device.

### Security measure

The network of UTokyo, including UTokyo Wi-Fi, is secured by UTokyo Campuswide Firewall and other measures to ensure information security.

- Some websites cannot be viewed over UTokyo Wi-Fi because they are blocked by UTokyo Campuswide Firewall.

  - The e-mail addresses of UTokyo WiFi Task Force are `utokyo-wifi-cert.adm_at_gs.mail.u-tokyo.ac.jp` or `utokyo-wifi-tf_at_itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp` (please read `_at_` as @).
  - Failure to respond to the email may result in account suspension. In order to reactivate a suspended account, you must consult with your department’s CERT and take reasonable steps to prevent a recurrence.

## Others

- There is no limit to the number of devices per account that can be connected to UTokyo Wi-Fi.
