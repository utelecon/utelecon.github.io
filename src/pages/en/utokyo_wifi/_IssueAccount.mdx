For first-time access or an account reissue, please go back to the main page of the UTokyo Wi-Fi and follow **Step 2** in “[Steps to start using the service](/en/utokyo_wifi#initial-setup)” to issue an account.

If you already have a valid UTokyo Wi-Fi account, there is no need to have an account issued again. One UTokyo Wi-Fi account can be used for two or more devices.
