## Introduction

The University of Tokyo provides internet environments primarily intended for educational and research activities. In student lodges, the university aims to offer internet access that accommodates diverse student lifestyles.

The lodge Wi-Fi network has fewer access restrictions than the campus network, enabling more flexible usage. However, users are expected to comply with laws and public order when using the internet.

## Usage Guidelines

- The "[Terms of Use for the University of Tokyo Wireless Network System](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/adm/dics/ja/wifi_termsofuse.html)" applies to the use of lodge Wi-Fi.
- Internet access is permitted without specific site restrictions, but users must adhere to the [UTokyo Basic Policy for Information Security](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/about/information-security.html) and use the network responsibly.
- Accessing inappropriate content or engaging in illegal activities is prohibited.
- This internet service is intended to support the daily lives of students in the lodges and allows for more diverse usage than the campus network. While the network is managed by the university, please note that we may not be able to provide detailed support for individual connection problems or the use of specific online services or games, as this environment is not designed primarily for educational or research purposes.
