## Roles

There are four main roles in Webex Training．
* **Host**： Hosts can start/ close the event,  change the other participants' authorizations and build breakout session.  However, hosts cannot share the contents, nor participate in a poll. 
* **Presenter**： Presenters can share the contents and change the other participants' authorizations. Presenters can also make and organize polls and breakout sessions.
* **Panelist**： Panelists can answer questions from participants.
* **Participant**： Participants can share their camera screen and mute/ unmute their microphone. However, if organizers or presenters mute participants, the unmute function becomes locked.
