## Roles

Webex Meetings has the following roles.
* **Host**： can start / end a meeting and assign users to “Presenter. ” They can also mute / unmute microphones of participants, but participants can cancel it themselves.
* **Presenter**： can share the contents. If the host has chosen the setting “Anyone Can Share,” the participant who shared the content automatically becomes the presenter. When "Anyone can share" is on, any participant can share content in the meeting.
* **Participants**： can mute / unmute the microphone and send the camera image. They can chat with other participants and the host.

## Screen composition

* When you enter the conference room, the following screen will be displayed (It looks different if another participant is already in the room).

	1. **Mute**： This button turns black when the microphone is on, and  turns red when muted. **Mute your microphone (make the icon red) when you don’t speak. Unexpected sounds may be leaked to other participants if you do not mute the mic.**
	1. **Stop video**： This button turns black when the camera is on, turns red when the camera is off.**If the connection environment is unstable, stop the video (make the icon red).**
	1. **Share contents**： Share your screens to share materials with other participants. There are three options: share your PC screen, share specific application windows, or share specific Chrome tabs. It is also used to show a PowerPoint document at hand, to show a video, and to show your writing by connecting to a OH camera, etc. There is also a whiteboard function, so you can share material you have handwritten on your device.
	1. **Record meeting**： You can record your meeting. You can save it to the cloud (on the Webex server) or your computer, but sometimes it does not allow you to save it to your computer, depending on the setting.
	1. **Participants**： Press the participant button to display a list of participants. In the participant list, you can hover your mouse over each name to send a direct message to that participant or to make that participant leave the meeting from a pull-down menu.
	1. **Chat**： Pressing the chat button will bring up a chat window where you can send a message to everyone or a specific person.
	1. **Other options**： There are other options here. You can prevent the entry to the conference room (when participants are not allowed to be late for a certain period of time, etc.), mute participants or generate a sound when someone new enters the meeting, etc. The voting function cannot be performed in the browser, and requires a desktop application.
	1. **Leave**：  Leave the conference room.

* The currently open window/app is also displayed as an option. You can  share a specific window/app to share. If you don't want participants to see the whole screen, select only the window/app you want to share.
