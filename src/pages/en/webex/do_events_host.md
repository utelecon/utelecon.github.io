## Functions only available to the host

### Mute all participants

* To mute everyone as they join, select "Mute on Entry" from the Participant menu.
* If the host selects "Mute on Entry", participants cannot unmute themselves during the event.

<!-- ### 参加者の入退室時のサウンド

* 参加者が入退室する時にサウンドを鳴らすことができます．気づかないうちに予期せぬ参加者が紛れ込むことを防ぐことができますが，参加者の多い会議では煩わしくなります．
* 「参加者」メニューの「入退室のサウンド」で設定します．

### Recording

* If you record the entire event and upload it on an online platform like UTOL (How to publish: TODO), you can use the recording as a learning material for students with poor communication conditions or as a material to review the class.
* You can start recording anytime during the event by clicking the recorder icon.
* Recorded video files are automatically saved in ARF format and saved in "My Training Recordings". You can also get a link (URL) with a password to share.

### How to Become a Host Again

* When the host gets disconnected due to network trouble, etc., other participants will automatically be assigned as a new host.
* In such case, join in the meeting as a participant, press "Change Role To" from the "Participant" menu, and select the “Host.”

* If you enable “Attendees can join at least n minutes before the start time” when scheduling the event time, participants can enter the training before the host. If a participant changes his/her own role to the host before the original host joins, he/she will be able to proceed the event as a host.
