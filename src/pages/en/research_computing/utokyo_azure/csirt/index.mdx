## Boundary of responsibility

UTokyo Azure is a cloud service that uses resources from Microsoft Azure services, and the boundary of responsibility varies depending on the service used.
- Depending on the type of service provided, this may not necessarily apply. UTokyo Azure CSIRT will ultimately determine the demarcation point of responsibility.
