## About UTokyo Azure

In August 2023, the University of Tokyo and Microsoft signed a basic agreement regarding future collaboration ([news release](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/articles/z1701_00013.html)). Based on this agreement, Microsoft provided the University of Tokyo with a donation (gift) in the form of credits for using Microsoft's cloud service, Azure.

"UTokyo Azure" is the name of a service that makes Microsoft's Azure cloud services widely available to members of the University of Tokyo through the gift credits provided.  It includes basic services including:

- Virtual machine service for running Linux and Windows and more environments
- A service that operates multiple Linux servers as a cluster (high-performance computing environment)

as well as

- Browser-based computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook
- Services that use Openai AI systems via a browser, and services that use it in API

Furthermore, a wide variety of CPUs and GPUs with various processor models and memory capacities is available, making the service applicable to a diverse range of purposes and fields.

## Operation Policies and Goals

Operation is performed by the Information Technology Center, the Information System Department, and the Information System Headquarters. The basic policies and goals are as follows.

- Lower the barrier to entry and minimize the time lag for starting use, encouraging a broad range of users, including first-time users, to take advantage of it. By eliminating the costs and time associated with procuring computing resources that would otherwise be necessary, we hope this service will contribute to accelerating research at the University of Tokyo.
- Make it available for a wide range of uses without restricting fields, provided the purpose is research or education.  
  - Note: Usage for administrative tasks is not permitted. For administrative purposes, please continue to use the [Microsoft licenses](/en/microsoft/) already contracted for the entire university.
- Allow access to as wide a range of Azure services as possible without narrowly restricting the available options.  
  - In principle, all services offered by Microsoft Azure will be made available as-is, and the operational team will not interfere with or become involved in individual users' environments.  
  - However, services deemed operationally difficult to provide may be excluded.  
  - Services that could easily incur high costs or consume significant resources may be disabled by default.  
- Provide a standardized environment of a certain scale to support users who wish to utilize typical use cases without the hassle of setting up their own environment (currently in the planning stage, including a needs assessment).
- Since the gift credits are limited, the total consumption of gift credits across the university will be controlled by setting a target value, within which usage will be free. If usage exceeds the established target, users may be charged based on the amount of the excess.

## Terms of Use and Related Information

- Terms of use, the amount of gift credits, cases where usage fees may apply, and the rules for calculating charges for each user are provided on the [internal information site](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utokyo-azure-internal-en/) (accessible with a University of Tokyo Google account --- [ECCS Cloud Mail](/en/google/) --- sign-in required). Please refer to this site for more information.

## Getting Started

<div class="box">
**Important：**This service will be available for up to five years while the gift credits are provided. There is no decision regarding its continuation after that, so please keep this in mind when considering long-term use. For more information: [UTokyo Azure:UTokyo Member-only Site](https://sites.google.com/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/utokyo-azure-internal-en/)
</div>

- First, please submit an application via the [**UTokyo Azure New Usage Application Page (accessible only within the university network)**](http://azure.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/).  
  - Applications can only be submitted by faculty or staff members who can take responsibility for payment if usage fees are incurred. Students who wish to use the service should consult with an appropriate person in a supervisory role, such as their academic advisor.

- Once your application is approved, a [**subscription (in Japanese)**](/research_computing/utokyo_azure/faq/subscription/) linked to your UTokyo Account will be assigned for this service. 

<div class="box">
**Important：**UTokyo Azure subscriptions have a unique feature that automatically cancels your subscription when 90% of the Guaranteed Free Tier has been used up; this feature is enabled by default. This is a feature for users who want to be sure to stop using the service within the Guaranteed Free Tier, but at that point the subscription will be canceled immediately, making it impossible to recover and preventing access to resources. **If you do not want your data or other resources to be canceled, please visit the [**UTokyo Azure New User Application Management Page**](http://azure.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/list) and remember to disable the "Automatic Suspension" feature for any subscriptions you do not want to cancel.**
</div>

- After the subscription is created, log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your [UTokyo Account](/en/utokyo_account/) to start using the service.  
  - You can log in to the portal even without an active subscription.
  - This allows you to check which services are available before applying.
