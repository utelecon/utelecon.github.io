If you want to share **subscriptions** or **resources** (scopes) with laboratory members or collaborators, the representative must apply for the subscription and add the collaborators to the subscription with appropriate roles. At that time, what the sharer can do depends on which scope and role they are assigned to.

## Recommended role assignments

| User  | Share | Scope | Role |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Faculty | Transfer your subscription | Subscription | Owner |
| For Faculty | Delegate expense and user management | Subscription | Owner |
| For Faculty | Not Delegate expense and user management | Subscription | Contributor |
| For Student | Delegate the creation of new resources | Subscription | Contributor |
| For Student | Not Delegate the creation of new resources | Resource | Contributor |

### Difference between an Owner and a Contributor

Both the Owner and Contributor have what are administrator privileges, but there are the following differences:

- **Owner**：
  - (Only if assigned to a subscription) You can view the Free tier, Guaranteed free tier, current usage, etc. on the subscription management page on the UTokyo Azure New application page.
  - You can assign a shared member role to a subscription, resource group, etc.
- **Contributer**：
  - Other than the two privileges mentioned above, the user has the same privileges as the owner.
