![resource-context-support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/media/how-to-create-azure-support-request/resource-context-support.png){:.border}

2. Follow the prompts to share more details about your issue. Some options may be preselected for you, based on the resource you were viewing when you selected `Support + Troubleshooting`. We'll look for solutions that might help you resolve the issue.

If none of the solutions resolve the problem you're having, select **Create a support request**.

## 3. Create a support request

When you create a new support request, you'll need to provide some information to help us understand the problem. This information is gathered in a few separate sections.

### Problem description

<div class="box">
The first step of the support request process is to select an issue type. You'll be prompted for more information, which can vary depending on what type of issue you selected. If you select Technical, specify the service that your issue relates to. Depending on the service, you might see options for Problem type and Problem subtype. Be sure to select the service (and problem type/subtype if applicable) that is most related to your issue. Selecting an unrelated service may result in delays in addressing your support request.

![support-request-problem-description](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/media/how-to-create-azure-support-request/support-request-problem-description.png){:.border}

After you provide all of the requested information, select `Next`.

### Recommended solution

Based on the information you provided, we provide some recommended solutions that might be able to fix the problem. In some cases, we may even run a quick diagnostic check. These solutions are written by Azure engineers to solve most common problems.

If you're still unable to resolve the issue, continue creating your support request by selecting `Return to support request`, then selecting `Next`.

### Additional details

Next, we collect more details about the problem. Providing thorough and detailed information in this step helps us route your support request to the right engineer.

1. Complete the `Problem details` so that we have more information about your issue. If possible, tell us when the problem started and any steps to reproduce it. You can optionally upload one file (or a compressed file such as .zip that contains multiple files), such as a log file or browser trace. For more information on file uploads, see File upload guidelines.
2. In the **Advanced diagnostic information section**, select `Yes` or `No`. Selecting `Yes` allows Azure support to gather advanced diagnostic information from your Azure resources. If you prefer not to share this information, select `No`. For details about the types of files we might collect, see [Advanced diagnostic information logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request#advanced-diagnostic-information-logs).
  - In some cases, you may see additional options. For example, for certain types of Virtual Machine problem types, you can choose whether to allow access to a virtual machine's memory.
3. In the **Support method** section, select the `Support plan`, the `Severity level`, depending on the business impact. The maximum available severity level and time to respond depends on your support plan and the country/region in which you're located, including the timing of business hours in that country/region.
4. Provide your preferred contact method, your availability, and your preferred support language. Confirm that your country/region setting is accurate, as this setting affects the business hours in which a support engineer can work on your request.
5. Complete the **Contact info** section so that we know how to reach you.

Select `Next` after you finish entering this information.

## 4. Review + create

Before you create your request, review all of the details that you'll send to support. You can select `Previous` to return to any tab if you want to make changes. When you're satisfied that the support request is complete, select `Create`.

A support engineer will contact you using the method you indicated. For information about initial response times, see [Support scope and responsiveness](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/response/).

## 5. Manage an Azure support request

#### View support requests

View the details and status of support requests by going to `Help + support` > `All support requests` in the Azure portal.

You can search, filter, and sort support requests. By default, you might only see recent open requests. Change the filter options to select a longer period of time or to include support requests that were closed.

To view details about a support request to view details, including its severity and any messages associated with the request, select it from the list.
