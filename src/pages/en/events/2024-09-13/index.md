h1: "Sep. 13, 2024: Information Session on ICT Systems and Tools for UTokyo Members (**Conducted in English**)"
---
**The session has ended. Materials and recordings are available on this page.**
## Purpose
At the beginning of the Autumn Semester, we will provide an overview of the ICT systems and tools used in UTokyo.

Educational and research activities at the university require the use of various ICT systems and tools, and UTokyo provides an environment to support these activities. Some of the systems have procedures that all members are required to follow and use.

You can learn about the UTokyo Account, information security obligations, on-campus Wi-Fi service, systems required for classes (UTAS, UTOL), and other tools and cloud services (Zoom, Slack, Google, Microsoft, etc.) available for education, research, and administrative works.

For the first time, the session will be conducted in English so that non-Japanese speakers can actively participate. We welcome those who are coming to UTokyo for the first time and will use ICT systems and tools hereafter, as well as those who have already used them in UTokyo. We look forward to your participation.

In addition, students are also welcome to attend the session, although the explanations will be primarily geared toward faculty and staff (especially Part III). Contents of the session will complement the guidance for new students provided by each faculty and graduate school.

The purpose of the pre-session questionnaire is to find out what kind of information needs non-Japanese-speaking faculty members have about ICT systems and tools. The questionnaire is optional, but we would like to prepare the session based on the responses we receive, so we would greatly appreciate your cooperation.

We also welcome responses from those who will not be attending the session, as our reference information.
