## Call for Poster Presentations

We welcome poster presentations by on-site participants.  
Whether you are already using UTokyo Azure or plan to start using it—faculty, staff, and students alike—we encourage you to submit an entry.  
We hope this will be an opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange among researchers and students across the University.
 
If you wish to present a poster, please select **“Poster Presentation”** in the registration form and provide the title of your presentation.

- **Poster presentation application deadline:** Monday, February 9 (Noon)
- **Poster Presentation Capacity:** Up to 30 presentations
- **Eligibility:** Open to faculty, staff, and students (UTokyo Azure usage is not required)
- **Board Size:** W 85 cm × H 175 cm (excluding the frame)
- **Poster Size:** Any format is acceptable—either a single A0 poster or multiple sheets (e.g., A4) arranged and posted together.
- **On-site Poster Setup**: Please print and bring your poster with you and display it on the board with your assigned number by **16:55**. The location and numbering of the boards will be provided at the venue on the day.
- **Lightning Talk**: For each poster, presenters will give a brief oral overview within one minute.  
  Please submit one PDF per presenter to be projected on the screen by 12:00 noon on the day before the event.
  - The submitted PDF may be in a standard slide format such as 16:9 or 4:3, or it may be the poster PDF itself.
  - File names are arbitrary.
    - Since the uploader’s name will be automatically appended to the file name, if someone other than the presenter uploads the file on their behalf, please name the file “PresenterName.pdf”.
  - During the lightning talks on the day, we will project the submitted materials sequentially on the screen.  
    Please give a brief explanation within one minute. After one minute, the display will automatically switch to the next material.  
    The screen will also show the name of the next presenter (the uploaded file name), so the next presenter should prepare to come to the stage accordingly.
