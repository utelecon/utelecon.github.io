## Introduction
{:#introduction}

This page explains the initial account setup and necessary systems for staff members (who are not directly in charge of education) to conduct their work.

**Note**: If your workplace uses Office Work Terminals (事務業務端末, thin client system or remote access environment for remote working), you will receive instructions from your department's PC equipment manager. After completing the initial setup of your UTokyo Account, please follow those instructions.

First, please complete the initial setup of your UTokyo Account by following these steps:

1. **Change your password from the initial password**
1. **Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
1. **Take the Information Security Education and pass the test**

For more details, please refer to the explanations below and the respective pages on utelecon.

Also, we provide updates and announcements via [the official X account](https://x.com/utelecon_pr_en). Please follow that and get the latest information.

For faculty members, please refer to [Getting Ready for ICT Systems at the UTokyo (for Faculty Members)](/en/faculty_members/).

### Troubleshooting: Technical Support Desk

If you have any problems or need advice on using information systems, please consult the **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support/)**. The Technical Support Desk provides consultation services through three tools: chat, online call, and email form. The Technical Support Desk will respond quickly through the collaboration of student staff "Common Supporters" and faculty members.

## Overall view of the UTokyo system

The UTokyo provides various information systems such as Microsoft, Google, and so on. In order to use these various systems, you need to sign in using a university-wide account called UTokyo Account. The following figure shows an overview of the UTokyo information systems.

![Overall view of the UTokyo system](overall_system_en_upside_down.png)

At the start of semesters, the UTokyo holds a briefing session for faculty and staff on the overview of each of the UTokyo systems. The information systems provided by the UTokyo are diverse and difficult to grasp, but the explanations of each system and its relationship are provided at the briefing sessions to make them easier to understand. Please refer to "[Information Session on ICT Systems and Tools for UTokyo Members (only in Japanese)](/events/2025-03-12/)" for the briefing for 2025 S Semester.

## Getting Started: Initial Setup of the Common ID "UTokyo Account", etc

“UTokyo Account” is a university-wide account used for signing in to UTokyo’s IT systems, such as Zoom and UTOL (which are explained later).

UTokyo Account is represented by a 10-digit number (Common ID) followed by `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, which indicates that you are a member of the University of Tokyo, such as `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.

The following is an explanation of the UTokyo Account’s initial setup procedure. Please read this section carefully, as it is an important procedure necessary for using UTokyo’s systems.
