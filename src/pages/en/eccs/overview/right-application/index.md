If you wish to use ECCS, you must obtain the "ECCS usage rights" in advance.

Once you have obtained the right, you can use ECCS with your UTokyo Account's common ID (10-digit) and password.

## The services that require the ECCS usage rights

You need to obtain the ECCS usage rights to use the following services.

- [ECCS terminals (Mac environment, Windows environment)](/en/eccs/)
- [ECCS WebDAV environment](/en/eccs/features/webdav/)
- [ECCS Remote Access environment](/en/eccs/features/ras/)
- [ECCS Printing](/en/eccs/features/printing/)
- [ECCS Portal](https://portal.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/)

Please note that although [ECCS Cloud Email](/en/google/) is named "ECCS", you do not need to obtain ECCS usage rights. Several services are provided by the Campus-wide Computing Research Division of the Information Technology Center, such as UTOL, which are the same as ECCS. Still, you do not need to obtain ECCS usage rights to use these either.
