Educational Campus-wide Computing System (ECCS) is a system that allows students and staff of the University of Tokyo to use computers and networks for research and education. The entire system is replaced approximately every few years. The current system, "ECCS2021" has been in operation since March, 2021. ECCS consist of ECCS terminals and ECCS multifunction printers distributed across campus, software available on the terminals, an environment that replicates the terminal environment, and a system that allows users to access data saved on terminals from outside the campus. Users log in with their accounts to use ECCS.
