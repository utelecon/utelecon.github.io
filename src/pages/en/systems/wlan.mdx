This page describes the wireless LAN services available to members of the University of Tokyo. If you are not a member of the University of Tokyo, please refer to the ["Wireless LAN Service at the University of Tokyo" page on the University of Tokyo website](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/adm/dics/ja/wlan.html).

## UTokyo Wi-Fi

UTokyo Wi-Fi is a Wi-Fi service available to members of the University of Tokyo for educational and research purposes. Currently, UTokyo Wi-Fi is available in most classrooms on the Hongo, Komaba, Kashiwa, and other campuses. It is connected to the university network and users can access databases, e-journals, e-books, etc. contracted with the University of Tokyo.

â†’Please refer to the **[UTokyo Wi-Fi page](/en/utokyo_wifi/)**.

## eduroam

[eduroam](https://eduroam.org/) is a wireless LAN service that can be used mutually among universities and research institutes. Members of the University of Tokyo can use eduroam at other universities and research institutes with the same user ID and password as their UTokyo Wi-Fi account. The steps for connecting are the same as those for UTokyo Wi-Fi, so please refer to the [UTokyo Wi-Fi page](/en/utokyo_wifi/). That said, you'll need to substitute the SSID from `0000UTokyo` to `eduroam`.

- Please refer to the [eduroam JP Privacy Policy](https://meatwiki.nii.ac.jp/confluence/x/WYX0BQ) when using eduroam.
- You can also use eduroam on the University of Tokyo campus, but your connection will be treated as an off-campus network, and you will not be able to use databases, e-journals, e-books, etc. The eduroam service on the University of Tokyo campus is provided for external users, so members should basically use the UTokyo Wi-Fi service on campus.
