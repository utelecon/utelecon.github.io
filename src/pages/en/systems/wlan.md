\* The former "[EDUROAM for u-tokyo.ac.jp members site](https://www.eduroam.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/cgi-bin/en/top.cgi)" will stop issuing new accounts on March 31, 2023, and accounts will no longer be available on and after May 1, 2023. Please use your UTokyo Wi-Fi account to use eduroam.

- Please refer to the [eduroam JP Privacy Policy](https://meatwiki.nii.ac.jp/confluence/x/WYX0BQ) when using eduroam.
- You can also use eduroam on the University of Tokyo campus, but your connection will be treated as an off-campus network, and you will not be able to use databases, e-journals, e-books, etc. The eduroam service on the University of Tokyo campus is provided for external users, so members should basically use the UTokyo Wi-Fi service on campus.
