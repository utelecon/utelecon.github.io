This page describes how to back up your data in the various information systems when you leave the University of Tokyo. Please refer to the "**[Notice on Account Revocation due to  Graduation, Resignation or Change of Affiliation](.)**" for more information on the revocation of your UTokyo Account when you leave the University of Tokyo.

**When you leave the University of Tokyo due to graduation, resignation, or other reasons, your UTokyo Account will be revoked and you will not be able to use the various information systems** such as Zoom, ECCS Cloud Email, and Microsoft 365 provided by the University of Tokyo. After your account has been revoked, you will not be able to access any data stored in the systems, so please **make backups of your data as necessary**. Some systems limit the amount of data that can be backed up at one time, so if you have a large amount of data to back up, we recommend that you do so well in advance of leaving the university.

Below is a description of how to back up data for the major information systems that require UTokyo Account. Please note that you should also back up data stored in the other systems that are not described here, if necessary.

For data used in a laboratory or a department, you can transfer the ownership of the data to another person so that the data can continue to be used even after the data owner leaves the university. You may consider taking this approach, as it does not require downloading the data or changing the shared links and is simpler than the method where the data owner makes a backup and passes the data to another person.

## Zoom

When your UTokyo Account is revoked, you will no longer be able to sign in to your Zoom account provided by the University of Tokyo, nor will you be able to access videos stored in cloud recordings on Zoom. Since it is not possible to restore the data after the revocation, please download videos as needed by referring to "[Managing and sharing cloud recordings](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205347605#h_01F4F8Z2FJCCE6KVBPGHNZEXSC)".

## ECCS Cloud Email

When your UTokyo Account is revoked, you will no longer be able to log in. Please perform the following three tasks as necessary.

- Back up your Google contents
- Set up email forwarding (valid for approximately 180 days)
- Change the settings of external accounts that use ECCS Cloud Email for sign-in

The details of each task are described below.

### Back up your Google contents

When your UTokyo Account is revoked, you will also not be able to access data in Gmail and Google Drive that you used with your ECCS Cloud Email account. Since it is not possible to restore the data after the revocation, please be sure to back up your data according to the procedure described in "[Backing up ECCS Cloud Email data before your graduation, etc.](https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/announcement/2019/02/25_2908.html)".

### Set up email forwarding

After your ECCS Cloud Email account has been revoked, you will not be able to read emails sent to your ECCS Cloud Email. If necessary, please set up forwarding of emails sent to ECCS Cloud Email to another email address by referring to "[Setting Up Email Forwarding for your ECCS Cloud Email](https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/announcement/2023/02/28_3511.html)". Please note that the forwarding setting will be automatically disabled approximately 180 days after the account revocation.

During the period of approximately 180 days after the account revocation, no error email will be returned to the sender that sends emails to ECCS Cloud Email. Therefore, if you have not set up forwarding, the sender may not be aware that your ECCS Cloud Email account has been revoked.

### Change the settings of external accounts that use ECCS Cloud Email for sign-in

Once the ECCS Cloud Email account is revoked, any external accounts that you sign in using the "Sign in with Google account" integration function will become unavailable. In addition, if you have registered to an external service account with your ECCS Cloud Email address, you may not be able to change your password or other settings after the revocation.

Therefore, please make sure that you can sign in without using ECCS Cloud Email in advance by linking it to other accounts or changing the registered email address.

## OneDrive

When your UTokyo Account is revoked, you will no longer be able to use the UTokyo Microsoft License provided by the University of Tokyo, and therefore will not be able to access files stored on OneDrive. Since it is not possible to restore data after it has been revoked, please download the data as necessary by referring to "[Download files and folders from OneDrive or SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/5c7397b7-19c7-4893-84fe-d02e8fa5df05)".

### Note for Windows users

If you are using the file synchronization function of OneDrive on Windows, folders such as "Desktop" and "Documents" may exist on OneDrive. Files downloaded from OneDrive for backup should be saved in a folder that is not synchronized with OneDrive.

## ECCS Terminal

After your UTokyo Account is revoked, you will not be able to access the data stored on your ECCS terminal. Please back up your data while your UTokyo Account is active.

You can save the data on your ECCS terminal to your own terminal via a USB memory stick or by using the [WevDAV environment](https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/webdav.html).
