**When you leave the University of Tokyo due to graduation, resignation, or other reasons, your UTokyo Account will be revoked and you will no longer be able to sign in.** As a result, you will no longer be able to sign in to the various information systems such as [Zoom](/en/zoom/), [ECCS Cloud Email](/en/google/) or [UTokyo Microsoft License](/en/microsoft/) provided by the University of Tokyo that require a [UTokyo Account](/en/utokyo_account/) for sign-in. After your account has been revoked, you will not be able to access any data stored in these information systems.

Please check which of the following applies to you, and **back up your data in advance if necessary**.

## If you are no longer affiliated with the University of Tokyo
{:#leave}

If you leave the University of Tokyo due to graduation or resignation, your UTokyo Account will be revoked after the end of the enrollment period and you will not be able to use the various information systems. Please back up your data according to the instructions given on the **“[Data Backup upon Leaving the University of Tokyo](backup)”** page.

Only if students graduate, the revocation will be at the end of the final month of the enrollment period.

Furthermore, some information systems, such as the [UTokyo Antivirus License](/en/antivirus/), are not automatically terminated even though you are no longer authorized to use them upon leaving the university. Please follow the instructions or each system to terminate their use.

Please refer to the "[UTokyo Antivirus License: Notes for Graduates and Leavers in FY2023<small>(*You must sign in with your UTokyo Account to view this page)</small>](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/antivirus/EWHWpO6rbANMnCDH3xtWQjcBtgwnBZ4G9KgIei0VlVSxtA)" page (in Japanese) for more information on the UTokyo Antivirus License.
- If you have already left the University of Tokyo, you cannot view the above pages because you cannot sign in to your UTokyo Account. In this case, please contact [the Technical Support Desk via the email form](/en/support/#email-form).

## If your affiliation changes within the University of Tokyo
{:#change}

If your affiliation changes within the University of Tokyo, **as long as your affiliation is uninterrupted**, you will continue to be able to use the information systems with the same UTokyo Account. Therefore, there is no need to back up your data.

- However, if your enrollment period is interrupted when you change your affiliation, your UTokyo Account will be revoked, so please make sure to back up your data according to the instructions on the "**[Data Backup upon Leaving the University of Tokyo](backup)**" page.
- Depending on whether you are a student or a faculty/staff member, your employment status and other factors, some systems may not be available to you, or the scope of functions you can use may be limited.
    - For example, only students and faculty/staff members employed by the University of Tokyo can install and use the Office applications under the UTokyo Microsoft License. If you no longer qualify for this due to a change in affiliation, you will no longer be able to use them.
    - And, for example, only faculty/staff members can access UTokyo Portal. If you no longer qualify for this due to a change in affiliation, you will no longer be able to access it.

## Appendix

- Since the period of enrollment is based on the information registered by the faculty or graduate school you belong to (the academic office for students and the personnel department for faculty and staff), please contact your faculty or graduate school if you wish to confirm the revocation date of your account.
    - Some systems such as UTAS and Personnel Information MyWeb will become unavailable at the same time as the end of the enrollment period.
- When your affiliation changes, you may not be able to use your UTokyo Account if your new affiliation is not supposed to grant UTokyo Account under its regulations, or if your UTokyo Account has not been properly registered at your new affiliation for some reason. If you wish to confirm how your UTokyo Account will be managed at your new affiliation, please contact your new faculty or graduate school in advance.
    - Emeritus Professors are eligible to use the UTokyo Account. However, since the title of emeritus professors is not conferred immediately after their resignation, certain procedures must be taken regarding the registration of enrollment information. Please contact the personnel department of your affiliation for details.
