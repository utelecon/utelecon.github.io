## Summary of This Article

In the article [What is Public Domain / Creative Commons?](../public-domain-creative-commons-license/) (also on this site) we explain how to use content without infringing on copyrights when creating course materials as a teacher, or when creating presentation slides or promotional materials for club activities as a student.
As an additional resource, this page introduces websites providing content that falls under the public domain and that is licensed under a Creative Commons license (hereafter referred to as "CC license"). Please use this page as a reference when searching for content.

### Sites Distributing General Materials

The following are websites that do not limit themselves to specific genres but deal comprehensively with information in all fields.

#### Wikimedia Foundation
