## Highlights of This Article
In this article, we will explain the basic use of Scrapbox.

### Suitable Situations to Use Scrapbox

* To prepare a page that summarizes class contents for easy learning.
* To summarize class materials with multiple users writing on them.
* To share the created materials easily and instantly.

### Things You Cannot Do

* It is not possible to give independent editing and viewing privileges to learners.

## What is Scrapbox?

Scrapbox is a tool provided by Nota Inc. for storing and organizing a large number of notes and memos online. It can be edited by multiple people at the same time or shared using URLs. It is characterized by its ability to easily connect many pages using "links" and "tags" and its portal function for online classes.

## Creating a Project
{:#create_project}

A project in Scrapbox is a unit of space used to organize information. Users can search for information in each project. It is also a unit for information sharing, and sharing settings can be configured for each project.

Below we will explain how to create a project.

1. Press the "S" button at the top left of the screen, and then select "Create new project". The "Create new project" button may appear on the screen immediately after you create an account.
2. Type any alphanumeric characters in the "Project name" field. It will be the sharing URL for students to view the articles in the project.
3. Set the detailed items of the project.
   * **Project Publication Settings**: You can choose between "Public Project" and "Private Project". Each project has the following features.
     * Public Project
       * This setting allows anyone who knows the public URL to view the project without authentication.
       * By sharing an "invite link", which is different from the public URL, you can also grant writing access to the page.
       * It is also displayed in search results of Google and other search engines.
     * Private project
       * Even if you know the project URL, users have no access rights cannot view the private  project.
       * To access private projects, you need an invitation link distributed by the administrator.
   * **"Upload image to"**: Select where you want to upload the image. Normally, you can select "scrapbox.io". The uploaded image will be saved on Scrapbox.
4. When you are done, click the green "Create" button.

## Creating and Editing a Page

A page in Scrapbox is a unit of information that is stored in a project. When using Scrapbox in a class, it is recommended to create a page for each class.

The page has the following features.

* The entered characters are immediately reflected in the display screen and search results. (No need to update the page.)
* Entries are automatically saved and backed up in chronological order. (It is possible to restore to previous version.)
* You can embed not only text, but also images and videos.
* You can create links within a page or to other pages in the project.

To create a page, go to the screen of the project you want to create a page for, and then click the ![](7.png){:.logo} button at the top of the screen to create a page.

The following explains how to format and edit a page.

### Entering Text

The first line is the title, and the second and subsequent lines are the body. The title line can be left blank. However, as  it will become the heading in the page list screen, it is recommended that you write something in it for easy location.

By typing a space at the beginning of a line, you can create a bullet list; pressing Enter will automatically move to the next bullet list. If you want to stop bulleting, press the Enter key twice.

You can create a hierarchy by typing a space at the beginning of each line. The depth of the hierarchy can be freely adjusted by the number of single-byte spaces.

You can also add decorations such as bold, italic, strikethrough and others. by selecting the text.

For example, if you select a string of text and choose "strong" from the window that comes up, you can make the text bold.

### Jumping From One Page to Another

If you want to structure pages (relate pages to each other), you can use the link function or the hashtag function.
You can automatically generate links by enclosing the string you want to link with `[ ]`, and hashtags by prefixing the string with `#`.

Links and hashtags are displayed in blue and pink respectively.
<figure>
<img src="11.png">
</figure>

Clicking on a link or a hashtag string will take you to a page titled with the respective string.  
If you click on the "Link" string in the previous image, you will be taken to a new page with the title "Link". From here, you can create a new page by typing the text.

<figure>
<img src="12.png">
</figure>

Pages with the same hashtag will be displayed together at the bottom of the screen. You can use the same hashtag for all related pages to make the connection easier to understand.

<figure>

Clicking on the project name in the upper left corner will take you to the page list screen (the top page of the project).
