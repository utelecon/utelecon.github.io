## Basic Information
{:#basic_info}

GoodNotes 5 is a note-taking/drawing application that allows you to annotate imported slides and documents (PDF, Power Point, Word, etc.) with your handwriting. By using it in combination with Zoom, you can conduct lectures while handwriting on the board.

While GoodNotes 5 can be used on an iPad, iPhone, or Mac, we recommend using it on an iPad when writing on the board. The small screen size of an iPhone makes it difficult to write detailed notes on the board, even with a stylus. Likewise, it is possible to write on the board with a Mac with a separately purchased graphic tablet, but it is not possible to write by  directly touching the screen like on an iPad.

You can purchase this app from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602).

This article provides information on how to use GoodNotes 5 on iPads using Apple Pencil (sold separately).

Note: Apple Pencil is the genuine Apple stylus and is only compatible with iPad. As of November 2021, Apple Pencil is not compatible with iPhone or Mac.

## Basic Usage
{:#tools}

For information about basic operation, see [GoodNotes 5 official website](https://support.goodnotes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000690095-Getting-started-with-GoodNotes-5) (only available in English, simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese).

Below is a brief description of how to use the basic tools.

### Pen Tool  

<figure>

The Pen Tool is the most basic handwriting tool on the page. You can choose from three pen options: fountain pen, ball pen and brush pen.

The handwriting of each pen is as shown in the images below.

The Eraser lets you erase text or lines drawn by the pen tool or the highlighter (described below).

By double-tapping the Eraser icon, an option menu will appear as shown in the image below. If you enable the options, it allows you to erase the entire stroke or only erase the highlighting.

### Highlighter
  
<figure>
<img src="pic13.jpeg">

With the Highlighter, you can draw over and emphasize original drawings or PDF text. The line will show through the drawing or text.

By double-tapping the Highlighter icon, an option menu with the option “Draw in Straight Line” will appear as shown in the image below. If it is enabled, lines you draw will be straightened automatically even if it is slightly blurred.

### Lasso Tool

<figure>
<img src="pic20.jpeg">

This tool allows you to select and move drawn text and graphics, as well as to resize them.

(Example) The image below shows the Lasso Tool moving an ellipse created with the Shape tool. The Lasso Tool is selecting the ellipse by circling it.

This tool allows you to select and insert images on the page, which can be selected from "Photos" or "Files" on your iPad. 
 To insert photos from the camera directly onto the page, you may use the Camera Tool, which can be found in the Image Tool’s contextual section.

The Pointer Tool displays a pointer at the touched position.

Two types of pointers are available: one is a pointer that follows the touch operation, while the other displays a trail that remains after the touch operation until the Apple Pencil is released from the screen.

### Screen Sharing
{:#with_zoom}

The simplest way to share the handwriting with students in real time is to share the GoodNotes 5 screen with Zoom.

For general information on how to use Zoom, please refer to "[Zoom](/en/zoom/)".

1. Join the Zoom meeting with your iPad. Tap “Share Content” from the menu bar and select ”Screen”. <img src="pic37.jpeg">
2. Tap “Start BroadCast”. <img src="pic38.jpeg">
3. The message “You are sharing your screen” will be displayed. <img src="pic39.jpeg">
4. When you switch the application from Zoom to GoodNotes 5, the screen of GoodNotes 5 will be shared. A red mark will appear in the upper right corner of the screen while the screen is being shared. <img src="pic40.jpeg">

Although not described in detail in this article, it is also possible to share the iPad screen from a Mac or Windows PC by using a method such as screen sharing using "AirPlay (or its screen mirroring software)".

### Writing 

After preparation and sharing the screen, you can now conduct the class.

You can write on GoodNotes 5 using the tools introduced so far.

The following video shows a demonstration of real-time writing during a class, where the shared screen projects the teacher’s handwriting with GoodNotes 5 onto students’ iPad screens. See how the Highlighter, Pen tool, Eraser tool, and Text tool are used.  ([ECCS Cloud Email](/en/google/) is necessary to watch the video.)

## Examples of Good Practices and Application (Japanese Only)
{:#advanced}

* [Professor Tadashi Shiraishi: Law I](/good-practice/interview/shiraishi)
  * Professor Shiraishi's class was a large class with about 400 students. He used GoodNotes 5 for handwriting during the lecture. After the lecture, images of the handwriting were uploaded to Scrapbox.
* [Professor Norikazu Saito: Numerical Mathematics I / Computational Mathmatics ](/good-practice/interview/saito)
  * Professor Saito's class was a medium-sized lecture with about 70 students. He used GoodNotes 5 for handwriting during the lecture, and shared the images of the handwriting as PDF files with the students after the lecture.

The following are some of the tips shared by the professors.

### Tips: Converting the Handwriting in Goodnotes 5 Into Documents
