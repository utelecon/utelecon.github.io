This page explains how to back up data from the ECCS Cloud Email.

When you leave the University of Tokyo due to graduation, resignation, or other reasons, your UTokyo Account will be revoked, and you will not be able to use ECCS Cloud Email. Since you will not be able to access your emails and data stored on Google Drive, please make sure to back up any necessary data before leaving the university.


There are two ways to back up data stored in ECCS Cloud Email:

* [Download the data](#download)
* [Transfer the contents to another Google account](#transfer)

What you can back up with each method is different, therefore, please select the appropriate method. 

## Downloading the Data
{:#download}

With this method, you can download most of the data that is stored on Google, including the following:

* Gmail
* Google Drive
* Contacts
* Google Classroom


For more details, please refer to "[Download Data Stored in ECCS Cloud Email](/google/misc/backup/download/) (in Japanese)".

You can also refer to "[How to download your Google data (Google Account Help)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190)".

## Transfer contents to another Google account
{:#transfer}

With this method, you can copy the following data to another account:

* Emails
* Files on Google Drive

For more details, please refer to "[Transfer contents from ECCS Cloud Email to another Google account](/google/misc/backup/transfer/) (in Japanese)."

You can also refer to "[Copy contents from your school account to another account (Google Account Help)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6386856)".

### Precautions

* Prior to backing up, you will need a Google account (such as a personal account or a Google Workspace account used at another university or company)  other than the ECCS Cloud Email.
* You need to have sufficient space available in the destination account.
  * The ECCS Cloud Email can store more data than a free account. If the destination account does not have enough storage, please use the "[Download Data](#download)" method.
