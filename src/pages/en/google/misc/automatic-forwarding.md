## How to Set Up Email Forwarding in General

Please refer to the Google Help article “[Automatically forward Gmail messages to another account](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en)”.

## Forwarding Settings for Those Leaving UTokyo (e.g. due to Graduation or Resignation)

Once your UTokyo Account expires, you will no longer be able to sign in to your ECCS Cloud Email. If you set up forwarding to an external email address while your UTokyo Account is still active, the setting will remain valid for approximately 180 days from the expiration date of your UTokyo Account. You will be able to receive emails sent to your ECCS Cloud Email address at the forwarded address during this period.
