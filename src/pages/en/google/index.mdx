## What is ECCS Cloud Email?

The ECCS Cloud Email is the email system of the University of Tokyo, which is linked to your UTokyo Account. 
It grants you access to the Google Workspace for Education, a suite of Google services such as Gmail and Google Drive.

If you have obtained a UTokyo Account, please make sure that your ECCS Cloud Email account is set up and ready to use, 
even if you already have a personal Google account. 
This is because some university pages and files are configured to allow access only through an ECCS Cloud Email account.
