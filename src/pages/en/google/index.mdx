## What is ECCS Cloud Email?

ECCS Cloud Email is a Cloud Email service that is available to all users with a UTokyo Account. It gives users access to Google Workspace for Education.  

The Google tools and services that are available through ECCS Cloud Email include: 

- **Gmail**：Email service using your Todai email address, `xxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`
- **Google Drive**：File storage service
- **Google Docs**：Word processor
- **Google Sheets**：Spreadsheet program
- **Google Forms**：Survey administration software
- **YouTube**：Online video-sharing platform
- **Google Meet**：Video communication service

Please refer to [the User’s Guide](https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/announcement/2017/04/26_2495.html) (currently available only in Japanese) in the ECCS website for a full list of available tools and services. 


Once you create a ECCS Cloud Email account, you can change your sharing settings to limit file access to users of ECCS Cloud Email (limited access). This is a feature that is not available to regular Google accounts. To access files limited to users of ECCS Cloud Email, users will need to set up their ECCS Cloud Email account, even if they already have a Google account.
