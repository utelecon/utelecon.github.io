## What is ECCS Cloud Email?

The ECCS Cloud Email is the email system of the University of Tokyo, which is linked to your UTokyo Account. 
It grants you access to the Google Workspace for Education, a suite of Google services such as Gmail and Google Drive.

If you have obtained a UTokyo Account, please make sure that your ECCS Cloud Email account is set up and ready to use, 
even if you already have a personal Google account. 
This is because some university pages and files are configured to allow access only through an ECCS Cloud Email account.

Your ECCS Cloud Email address (aka username) follows the format `xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`. 
When setting up of your account, you can choose an appropriate name to appear before the “`@`” symbol. 
If you do not specify one yourself, your email address will automatically be set to "your 10-digit Common ID+`@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp`".
For more details, please refer to the page 
"[Restrictions and specifications regarding email addresses (in Japanese)](../../google/misc/localpart/)".
