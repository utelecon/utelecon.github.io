## Introduction

Google Groups is a service provided by Google that offers a place for the discussion of shared topics. It provides convenient features for group activities, such as creating mailing lists and sending emails to all members of the group at once.<InPreparation />

With an ECCS Cloud Email, you can use not only the regular Google Groups features available with general Google accounts, but also additional features designed for organizations. You can choose which type to use, but for activities conducted as part of the University of Tokyo, using Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email users is more convenient.

Please note that if permission settings in Google Groups are configured incorrectly, there is a risk of information leaking to unrelated parties. Be sure to refer to this page and [the documentation on Google Groups privacy settings (in Japanese, sign-in with a UTokyo Account is required)] (https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/Security/Shared%20Documents/CISO\_Notices/r030525-ciso-besshi.pdf) to configure the settings appropriately.
