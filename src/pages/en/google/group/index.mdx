## Introduction

Google Groups is a service provided by Google that offers a place for the discussion of shared topics. It provides convenient features for group activities, such as creating mailing lists and sending emails to all members of the group at once.

With an ECCS Cloud Email, you can use not only the regular Google Groups features available with general Google accounts, but also additional features designed for organizations. You can choose which type to use, but for activities conducted as part of the University of Tokyo, using Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email users is more convenient.

Please note that if permission settings in Google Groups are configured incorrectly, there is a risk of information leaking to unrelated parties. Be sure to refer to this page and [the documentation on Google Groups privacy settings (in Japanese, sign-in with a UTokyo Account is required)](https://univtokyo.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/Security/Shared%20Documents/CISO\_Notices/r030525-ciso-besshi.pdf) to configure the settings appropriately.

## Features of Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email Users

The basic functions of Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email users are the same as those of the general Google Groups. However, there still remain differences in the areas outlined below.

- Google Group Email Addresses:
   - General Google Groups: [xxxx]@googlegroups.com
   - Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email users: [xxxx]-group@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp
     - You can set the [xxxx] part on your own.
     - For college/faculties/graduate schools or departments that use the Information Technology Center’s Email Hosting Service, it is also possible to use addresses in the form of [xxxx]@(the organization’s domain name). For details, please consult your organization's domain administrator for the Email Hosting Service.
- Group Settings:
  - Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email  allows you to restrict access to your group to “Organization members” only (i.e. only members with an ECCS Cloud Email).
    - For example, if you set “Users who can search for the group” to “Entire organization”, then only ECCS Cloud Email users will be able to search for and find that group.
- Group Administrators:
  - General Google Groups: Any user 
  - Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email users: ECCS Cloud Email users 
    - It is recommended to avoid granting administrative privileges such as “Group owner” or “Group manager” to users outside the ECCS Cloud Email organization as much as possible.
- Involvement of the Information Technology Center:
  - General Google Groups: The Information Technology Center is not involved in their operation and cannot intervene at the system level.
  - Google Groups for ECCS Cloud Email users: As a general rule, the Information Technology Center does not get involved in their operation. However, depending on usage, settings may be modified, and in cases involving legal issues, a group may be deleted.

  - For administrative functions, select “Group owners” or “Group managers”
- Even in cases such as inquiry-response groups, where posting by non-members is necessary, please configure the settings to allow non-members the bare minimum. For example, limit permissions for “Entire organization” or “Anyone on the web”, to only “Who can post”.
{/* 写真create-group2 */}

3. Enter the email addresses of the members you want to add to the group under “Group members”.

{/* 写真create-group3 */}

4. When you select “Create group”, the group will be created.

### Use as a Mailing List

To use Google Groups as a mailing list, specify the group’s email address as the recipient. However, as expanded on below, the sender may be required to be a member of the destination group to do so.

- When membership in the destination group is required: This applies when the group setting for “Who can post” is set to “Group members”. This is the case for many groups.
- When membership in the destination group is not required: This applies when the group setting for “Who can post” is set to “Anyone on the web”. For example, inquiry-response Google Groups are sometimes configured this way.

If membership in the destination group is required and you wish to join an existing group, please provide your email address to the group administrator and ask to be invited. Please note that in some cases, you may not be able to request to join a group from the search results in “All Groups”. If you wish to create your own group, please refer to Create a Group.

### Sending emails using a Google Group email address

You can send emails using the email address assigned to a Google Group. This allows multiple people to share and use a single email address. For instructions on how to configure this, please refer to [“Sending an email with a group email address as the sender (in Japanese)”](https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/google/group/mail_sender/).

### Use as a collaborative inbox

By using the collaborative inbox feature of Google Groups, you can label conversations and assign them to group members. This can be useful for help desks and similar applications.

This feature is available only for Google Groups used by ECCS Cloud Email users. To use it, the group owner or manager must enable the collaborative inbox feature in the group settings. For more details, please refer to [“Use a group as a collaborative inbox – Google Workspace Learning Center”](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/167430?hl=en&sjid=5390348718142281821-NC).

## Integration with other Google services

In other Google services, by specifying a Google Group email address as a recipient for sharing, you can collectively grant permissions to all members of that group.
