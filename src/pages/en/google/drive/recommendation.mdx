### Advantages of Sharing Files on Google Drive
First, Google Drive includes authentication and verification features that enable secure file sharing. Members of the university can be authenticated using their [ECCS Cloud Email](../../google/) accounts, while external users, even those who do not have a Google account can verify their identity using a verification code. This ensures that files are shared securely.

Additionally, by using Google Drive, you can work with high productivity. By sharing files in a folder for each meeting, multiple users can edit these files together without having to adjust sharing settings for each file individually.

## Case by Case Usage
### Sharing Files with Members of the University
#### Editing Files/Folders with Members of the University
{:#univ-share}
When editing files/folders with members of the university, it is recommended that you create a folder and share it with **specific users** by granting them “**editor**” access. This allows for collaborative editing between the sender and recipients without the need to share files individually each time.

For detailed procedures, please refer to “[Sharing files with Specific Users](../../../google/drive/share/)” (in Japanese) on “[Share files on Google Drive](../../../google/drive/share/#individual)” (in Japanese).

Additionally, if you want to manage files continuously with teams consisting of multiple people or within organizations, the “Shared Drive” function is more convenient. For more details on this function, please refer to the “[‘Shared Drive’ in Google Drive](./shared_drive/)”.

#### Publicizing Files to Members of the University
{:#univ-release}
If you want to publicize files to members of the university such as students, faculty, and staff, it is recommended that you share files with **nonspecific people** by granting them “**viewer**” access within the range of “**東京大学ECCSクラウドメール (UTokyo ECCS Cloud Email)**”.

For detailed procedures, please refer to “[Sharing files with Nonspecific Users](../../../google/drive/share/#procedure-unspecified)” (in Japanese) on “[Share files on Google Drive](../../../google/drive/share/)” (in Japanese).

### Sharing Files with External Users
#### Editing Files/Folders with External Users
{:#outside-share}
It is also possible to share files with external users. It is recommended that you share files to external users by granting them “**editor**” access if you want to edit files with them. 

Additionally, if the user (visitor) you want to share files with accesses the link using an email address other than a Google account, a verification code will be sent to that mail address, and the user will be required to enter the code on the verification screen. 

For detailed procedures, please refer to “[Sharing files with Specific Users](../../../google/drive/share/#individual)” (in Japanese) on “[Share files on Google Drive](../../../google/drive/share/)” (in Japanese).

#### Publicizing Files to External Users
{:#outside-release}
If you want to publicize files to external users in the read-only mode, it is recommended that you share files with **nonspecific people** by granting them “**viewer**” access within the range of “**anyone with the link**”.

For detailed procedures, please refer to “[Sharing files with Nonspecific Users](../../../google/drive/share/#procedure-unspecified)” (in Japanese) on “[Share files on Google Drive](../../../google/drive/share/)” (in Japanese).
