<Emergency />

The Technical Support Desk aims to respond to inquiries regarding information systems at the University of Tokyo.
To expand our services, support is co-operated by student staff ("Common Supporters") and faculty members.

We offer assistance through email form, chat, and online call. Please contact us through the appropriate channel for your inquiry.

<div class="box">
  Starting February 26, 2026, the on-site support previously provided by [ECCS Tutors](/eccs/support/#tutors) will be integrated into this utelecon support desk, and we will continue to provide assistance under this new framework.
