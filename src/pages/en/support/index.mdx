<summary>For inquiries containing sensitive information which could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff</summary>
For inquiries containing sensitive information which could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff, special handling will be conducted via a dedicated form as described below.

- Information is considered to be sensitive if **there is a possibility that a member of student staff is a relevant party to the inquiry and this could cause a problematic situation**. An example of such sensitive content would be information regarding a student's grades.
    - Unless this condition is met, contents such as personal accounts and contact information, information related to operations performed in the system, and internal information of departments and laboratories are NOT considered to be sensitive. Since student staff have signed necessary agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty and staff members, there is no problem with the handling of these kinds of information.
- Inquiries submitted through the dedicated form will be addressed solely by faculty and staff members, unlike regular inquiries. However, we will ask for the sections you deem sensitive and the reasons why in this form, and if the inquiry seems not to be considered sensitive, we may ask you to allow handling the inquiry by student staff.
- The number of faculty and staff members who respond is limited. Therefore, it takes longer time to respond than regular inquiries, at least a few days.

If your inquiry does not contain sensitive information, please use the regular inquiry form above instead of this dedicated form.
