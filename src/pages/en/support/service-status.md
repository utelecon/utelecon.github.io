Information from “[Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/),” a service that notifies you of possible failures based on SNS posts, may also help determine whether or not there are problems with systems provided by external organizations such as Zoom, Webex, ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace), and UTokyo Microsoft License. (Please note that this is not official information from the provider of each system.)

Also, the University of Tokyo’s network connects to the Internet via the academic information network “SINET,” which is operated and maintained by the National Institute of Informatics. Please also refer to the [SINET Announcements](https://www.sinet.ad.jp/announce) (in japanese) as the university’s systems and network may be affected by SINET failures or maintenance.
