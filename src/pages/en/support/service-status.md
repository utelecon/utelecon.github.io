Information from “[Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/),” a service that notifies you of possible failures based on SNS posts, may also help determine whether or not there are problems with systems provided by external organizations such as Zoom, Webex, ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace), and UTokyo Microsoft License. (Please note that this is not official information from the provider of each system.)
