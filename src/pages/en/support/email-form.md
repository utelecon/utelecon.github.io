This is a page for **email form** support at the utelecon Support Desk.

## Before Inquiring

Please be sure to check [the Support Desk page](../) before inquiring.

### Important Notes on Privacy and Confidentiality of Information 

- To ensure prompt response, **the support desk is generally staffed by students, as well as faculty staff. Please be aware of that fact when you make inquiries.** Student staff have signed confidentiality agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty and staff members, so there is no problem with general account information.
- If you have any questions or concerns about examinations, **please first contact your instructor or the department/graduate school that offers the examination. If you wish to contact the Technical Support Desk regarding examinations**, please contact us only through the email form. 
- Information obtained from inquiries will be used for replying to and performing tasks related to the inquiry. Information may be shared internally to improve future support service. Information may also be disclosed to the public in individually unidentifiable form for the purpose of introducing UTokyoâ€™s support initiatives through case studies and statistical information, etc. Information will not be used for any other purposes except for exceptions specified by laws and regulations.
- For information systems which departments independently provide, we may not be able to answer. For such systems, please consider contacting the department.

### Notes on Email Form

- After submitting the form, a confirmation email and responses to your inquiry will be sent to the email address you provided in the form. Therefore, if you enter your email address incorrectly, you will not receive both the confirmation email and the response to your inquiry. **Please be very careful when entering your email address**. Also, **if you do not receive a confirmation email, please submit your inquiry again through the form**.

<summary>For inquiries containing sensitive information which could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff</summary>
For inquiries containing sensitive information which could potentially hinder the proper execution of duties if handled by student staff, special handling will be conducted via a dedicated form as described below.

- Information is considered to be sensitive if **there is a possibility that a member of student staff is a relevant party to the inquiry and this could cause a problematic situation**. An example of such sensitive content would be information regarding a student's grades.
    - Unless this condition is met, contents such as personal accounts and contact information, information related to operations performed in the system, and internal information of departments and laboratories are NOT considered to be sensitive. Since student staff have signed necessary agreements and handle information under the control and supervision of faculty and staff members, there is no problem with the handling of these kinds of information.
- Inquiries submitted through the dedicated form will be addressed solely by faculty and staff members, unlike regular inquiries. However, we will ask for the sections you deem sensitive and the reasons why in this form, and if the inquiry seems not to be considered sensitive, we may ask you to allow handling the inquiry by student staff.
- The number of faculty and staff members who respond is limited. Therefore, it takes longer time to respond than regular inquiries, at least a few days.

If your inquiry does not contain sensitive information, please use the regular inquiry form above instead of this dedicated form.
