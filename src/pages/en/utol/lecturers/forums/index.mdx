## Overview
{:#overview}

The Forums function allows enrolled students in UTOL courses to communicate with each other and the course instructors in a two-way manner. It is more similar to a chat than a regular email, and can be used for exchanging questions about classes, doing group work discussions, and sharing opinions among students.

### Advantages of Use

The following are some of the advantages of using the UTOL Forums function:

- Since everything is handled within UTOL, all enrolled students can use it without any special setup.
  - There is no need to invite enrolled students to external tools (such as [UTokyo Slack](/en/slack/)) or for students to register for the tool.
- You can use the [markup function](../../markup/) to post messages containing mathematical formulas and links.
- It is also possible to create forums that are usable only by specific enrolled students, which is useful for group work discussions.

### Relationship between "Themes", "Threads", and "Messages"

+ In UTOL's forums, "Themes," "Threads," and "Messages" are structured hierarchically.

- **Themes**: This is the general outline of the topic to be discussed.
- **Threads**: This is used to organize discussions by topic within a theme. You can add multiple threads to a single theme. When a new theme is created, a "Default Thread" is automatically generated.
- **Messages**: This is each individual post within a thread. Messages can include titles, contents (text), and attachments.

### Workflow

The general workflow for using the Forums function is as follows:

1. [Registering Themes](#register-theme)
2. [Registering Threads](#register-thread)
3. [Posting Messages](#post-messages)

For information on how to view messages, refer to "[Viewing Posts](#view-messages)".

In addition, course instructors and TAs can also [check the forum viewing status](#check-view-status).
