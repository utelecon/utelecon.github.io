## Overview
{:#overview}

The Forums function allows enrolled students in UTOL courses to communicate with each other and the instructors in a two-way manner. It is more similar to a chat than regular email, and can be used for exchanging questions about classes, doing group work discussions, and sharing opinions among students.

### Advantages of use

The following are some of the advantages of using UTOL's forum function.

- Since everything is done on UTOL, all students can use it without special settings.
  - There is no need to invite students to other tools (such as [UTokyo Slack](/en/slack/)) or for students to register for the tool.
- You can use the [markup function](../../markup/) to post messages containing mathematical formulas and links.
- When using the forum for group work discussions, it is also possible to set the forum to be visible only to certain students.

### Relationship between "topics", "threads", and "messages"

In UTOL's forums, "topics", "threads", and "messages" are structured hierarchically.

- **Topics**: This is the general outline of the topic to be discussed.
- **Threads**: This is the framework for each topic that can be created for a theme. Multiple threads can be registered for a single theme. A "default thread" is generated when a new theme is registered.
- **Messages**: This refers to each individual post within a thread. Messages can include titles, text, and attachments.

### Flow of use

The flow for posting messages using the Forums function is as follows.

1. [Registering topics](#register-theme)
2. [Registering threads](#register-thread)
3. [Posting messages](#post-messages)

For information on how to view posted messages, refer to "[Viewing Posts](#view-messages)".

In addition, instructors and TAs can also [check the forum viewing status](#check-view-status).
