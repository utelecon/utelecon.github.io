## About Information Notices
{:#about}

This page provides detailed information on the usage of the information notices function in [UTOL](/en/utol/). This feature allows information to be sent as one-way text messages to all or some of the enrolled students. If you wish to make bidirectional contact with specific enrolled students, please use the “[Message](/en/utol/lecturers/messages/)” function.

The features of the information notices are as follows.

* When you register the information notice, you can set up the automatic sending of notifications to enrolled students.
  * Please note that **notifications will be sent only if the enrolled students have made changes to their settings to allow notifications to be received** (For more details on notification settings, please refer to “[Settings in UTOL to receive notifications](/en/utol/notification/)”).
  * The contents of the notification will be provided directly in the notification.

* You can confirm the list of enrolled students who have read the notifications on UTOL. For more details on the procedures, please refer to the “[Checking that an information notice has been opened](#check)” setting, discussed below.

### Reminder Notices (Reminder Information)
{:#reminder}

In addition to regular information notices, there are “Reminder Information” (hereinafter reminder notices) in the information notices. The reminder notices are requests such as those reminding the submission of assignments, quizzes, surveys, etc.

* Reminder notices will be displayed for those who have not submitted certain required information.
* Email and LINE notifications are automatically enabled. However, **if enrolled students have not set up their notifications, they will not receive them.**
* Reminder notices are displayed in the same column as regular notices.

#### Template for the reminder notices
{:#templates}

There is a template function for the reminder notices because it is expected that texts in the reminder notices will often be the same and used repeatedly in many situations. This function allows you to use prepared texts for multiple reminder notices.

The template is independent for each user, even within the same course. For example, in case of a course with multiple course instructors, the templates created by some course instructors cannot be used directly by other course instructors. However, it is possible to duplicate a template created by another user, and then modify it to create your own template.

#### Conditions and periods for registering reminder notices
{:#condition}

To register reminder notices, the following conditions are required.

* It must be before or during the content submission period.
  * Please note that **assignments that are set as “late submission is enabled” can be registered in the Reminder Notices even after the submission period**.
* (For surveys) It must be an open survey.
  * If you change from an open survey to an anonymous survey, your registered Reminder Notices will be deleted.

### Operation authority for each course participant
{:#permissions}
