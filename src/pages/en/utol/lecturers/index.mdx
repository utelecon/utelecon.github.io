## Introduction

This page provides explanations on how to use UTOL as a faculty member or TA. For how to use UTOL as a student (enrolled student), please refer to “[Using UTOL as an enrolled student](../students/)”.

The first part of this page provides instructions on how to check the list of courses you are in charge of as a faculty member or TA. The latter half explains how to use each function, such as Message or Notices, along with setting up course-related functions. Lastly it explains how to apply to create new courses.

### Settings to Receive Update Notification

UTOL has a function which allows you to receive update notifications via email, LINE, or UTokyo Slack whenever updates are made on the courses you are in charge of or are registered for. We recommend that faculty members and TAs enable this function in advance to respond smoothly to inquiries from enrolled students. Please refer to “**[Settings in UTOL to receive notifications](../notification/)**” for the setup procedure.
