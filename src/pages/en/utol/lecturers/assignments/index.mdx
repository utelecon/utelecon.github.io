## Overview

The assignment function allows you to provide assignments to enrolled students on UTOL and grade their submissions. You can set a specific deadline, and the submission date as well as the time can be recorded. In addition, you can configure whether or not late submissions are allowed and whether or not students can view each other's submissions.

There are two ways to submit assignments: "Text directly input" and "Upload File".

- Text directly input
  - Enrolled students submit assignments by entering text directly on UTOL.
  - It is suitable for assignments with short text, such as comments or reaction papers.
- Upload File
  - Enrolled students submit assignments by uploading deliverables (PDF files, etc.) from their terminals.
  - It is suitable for assignments with a certain amount of content and structure, such as presentation slides and reports, or assignments including contents other than text.
  - The file size limit is up to 100MB.

The following section covers three topics: "Managing Assignments", "Checking the Submission Status of Assignments", and "Evaluating Assignments". There are two ways about "Checking the Submission Status of Assignments": "Checking the Submission Status of All Assignments" and "Checking the Submission Status of Each Assignment".

In addition, course instructors, TAs and course designers can manage the assignments. However, only course instructors and TAs can grade the assignments.

## Managing Assignments

This section provides steps for managing assignments (registering, editing and deleting).

### Settings for Assignments
{:#setting-entries}

First, the following is a list of items that can be configured for the assignment. (The explanation will be divided into two images.)

![設定項目1](./01-settings-01.png){:.center}

- **Title** (Required)
  - e.g.: "Comment on the First Lecture", "Final Report"
- **Contents**
  - Enter the description of the assignment.
- **Attachments**
  - Attach any files that may be useful for the assignment, etc.
  - You can attach up to three files, each with a maximum size of 100MB.

![設定項目2](./02-settings-02.png){:.center}

- **Submission Period** (Required)
  - e.g.: From the start of the class to the start of the next class
  - If you are OK with allowing submission to start immediately, leave the start time as it is, and do not change it.
- **Submission method** (Required)
  - Select the submission method ("Upload File", "Text directly input").
- **Late submission** (Required)
  - Specify whether or not enrolled students can submit assignments after the end of the submission period.
  - It is safer to leave the setting as "Enable", as the load will be concentrated on UTOL near the end of the submission period, and there is a possibility of arising problems such as submission failure.
  - You can later check whether the assignments were submitted within the submission period. This allows you to accept late submissions while deducting points as necessary.
- **Reference of grade** (Required)
  - Specify whether or not enrolled students can access grades for assignments.
    - Reference:
      - [Evaluating Assignments](#evaluate)
- **Cross-Reference of submissions**
  - If you set this option as "Enable", the enrolled students will be able to access each other's submissions.
  - For example, when an enrolled student gives a presentation in class, it would be helpful if other enrolled students could access the submitted handout or slides, thus ensuring that the class proceeds smoothly.
- <DisplayLabel />
  - Reference:
    - [Configuring Course Settings in UTokyo LMS (UTOL, for Course Instructors/TAs) > Labels](../settings/#label)
- **Published target**
  - Select the published target for assignments. You can select one of the following three options.
    - "All Enrolled Students"
    - "Selected user group"
      - You can publish to specific user groups created in advance.
      - Reference:
        - [Using user group function in UTOL (for Course Instructors / TAs)](../settings/user_groups/)
      - You can check the enrolled students belonging to the user group by clicking on the group name.
    - "Select Students"
      - You can select specific enrolled students for publication.
      - After displaying a list of enrolled students, tick the enrolled students' names you wish to publish to.

## Evaluating Assignments
{:#evaluate}

This section provides procedures for evaluating assignments. There are two kinds of optional evaluating as follows.

- "Grade"
  - This is a simple evaluation of assignments.
  - In text format, and up to 255 characters can be entered.
- "Feedback Comments"
  - This consists of "Comment" and "Feedback file".
  - "Comment"
    - This is detailed feedback on an assignment.
    - In text format, and up to 1300 characters can be entered.
  - "Feedback file"
    - This is feedback in a format other than text.
      - Example: PDF file summarizing the issues

Please note that once an instructor has graded or added comments to an assignment file submitted by a student, the student will no longer be able to delete that submission. Therefore, when requesting a resubmission, please either instruct the student to rename the file before re-uploading it, or delete the existing file yourself to allow the student to resubmit it using the same filename.

There are two methods of evaluating, "Evaluating on UTOL", or "Evaluating by downloading the format". They have the following differences.

- [Evaluating on UTOL](#evaluate-on-utol)
  - Evaluating is done by operating UTOL.
  - All tasks are completed within the browser, making it simple. However, evaluating must be done individually for each enrolled student.
- [Evaluating by downloading the format](#evaluate-with-format)
  - Download a formatted Excel file (`.xlsx` format) or ZIP file (`.zip` format) and enter the evaluations there. After uploading the file, UTOL will read it and apply the evaluations.
  - This method is convenient if you have many enrolled students, as it allows for batch evaluation. However, it requires some getting used to working with it.
  - In addition, a password must be set for the formatted file after downloading.

### Evaluating on UTOL
{:#evaluate-on-utol}

1. Go to the screen for evaluating assignments using one of the following methods. 
   - From "[Checking the Submission Status of All Assignments](#submission-status-all)"

2. After the "Register/Edit assignment feedback" screen opens, add "Grade", "Feedback comments" and upload the "Feedback file", followed by clicking the "Register" button.
