## What is the user group?
{:#about}
In the courses on [UTOL](../../../), you can create units called “user groups” from among the students taking the course. These are used to make course contents (such as [course materials](../../materials/) and [assignments](../../assignments/)) available only to certain students, allowing you to choose to make the contents available only to certain user groups.

If you frequently restrict access to contents to certain students, you can avoid the trouble of specifying which students can access them each time by registering user groups in advance. One possible case of use is when you want to divide the students into several groups and make different contents available for each group in a group work project.

## Notes for using the user group function
{:#details}
- Only the course designer or instructor can manage user groups (register, change, delete). TAs cannot manage them.
- One student can be registered in multiple user groups.
- When publishing contents, you can select multiple user groups as the target for publication.

### Relation to the course group
{:#course_group}
When you register a [course group](../course_group/), a user group with members who are enrolled in each of the grouped courses are automatically registered with the name “(academic year)\_(department code)\_(timetable code)-group”. This is called the “default user group”. If the enrolled students are changed on UTAS after registration, the changes will be reflected in the list of members of each default user group through system integration.

## Managing user groups
{:#manage}
This section explains the procedures for managing (registering, changing, and deleting) user groups.

### Registering a user group
{:#register}
There are two ways to register a user group.

- Registration by selecting on the screen
![](register_web.png){:.medium}
    - With this method you can select members on the UTOL screen and register them as a single user group.
    - This is suitable for cases where you are registering only one user group or where there are only a few members to register.

- Registration by uploading an Excel file
![](register_excel.png){:.border}{:.medium}
    - Use this method to register one or more user groups by uploading an Excel file containing information about the user groups and their members.
    - This is suitable for registering multiple user groups at once or when electronic data is available on the student's common IDs or student ID numbers.
