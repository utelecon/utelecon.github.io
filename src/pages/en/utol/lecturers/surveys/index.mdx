## The survey function is…
The survey function allows you to conduct either non-anonymous or anonymous surveys for enrolled students.
Moreover, it enables you to display the aggregated results to the enrolled students on UTOL and respond to individual answers if needed.

### Course Surveys
Course Surveys are anonymous surveys conducted by some departments for enrolled students.

The basic operation of Course Surveys is almost the same as that of regular surveys. However, course instructors’ authorization will be limited to “**viewing aggregated results only**”. 
In particular, they are not able to view individual responses, so **the descriptive answers are not accessible**.

In addition, the authorization given to TAs and course designers is similarly restricted, but unlike course instructors, TAs and course designers are not able to access the aggregated results.

The method for the instructor to check the aggregated results is the same as for regular surveys.
Please refer to “[Viewing Aggregated Results”>”Reviewing the Summary Results](result/#view-result)”

## How to Use
