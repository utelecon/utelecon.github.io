## What is the Quiz function?

The quiz function allows you to create quizzes for students to take on UTOL, just like paper tests. It includes functions for creating and editing quizzes, and, scoring, and assessing grades.

Based on the content you intend to test, you can create a quiz by combining four formats: single-selection, multiple-selection, free-text (free description), and fill-in-the-blanks. Except for the free-text format, automatic scoring is possible for all formats.

### The advantages of performing quizzes using UTOL

There are various methods for performing quizzes online, for example, utilizing external tools such as Google Forms, but the UTOL quiz function has the following advantages over these methods.

-   A time limit can be set.

-   The students\' quiz answer status can be checked immediately.

-   The data of the quiz results can be downloaded immediately.

### Caution

The following are points that need to be considered when using the quiz function.

-   If you assign a quiz as homework, students may cheat or share answers with each other.

-   Students cannot submit answers after the answering period has ended.

    -   You must create a separate test if you want to allow students to submit answers outside the answering period.

    -   Please consider using the assignment function, which allows you to set an answering period.

-   Please tell students not to open multiple tabs or windows while taking the quizzes. Depending on how they operate the system, their answers may disappear.

-   You must act on students who could not submit their answers.

    -   If the students are not familiar with the operation or if there is a network problem on their side, they may not be able to submit their answers.

    -   It is safer not to use the scores directly in the grades until both the instructor and students are familiar with the system.

-   For the automatic scoring, there are cases where answers that should be correct are marked as incorrect.

    -   This is mainly due to differences in the way answers are written.
