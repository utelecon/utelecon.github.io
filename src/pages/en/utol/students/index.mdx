This page explains how to use UTOL as a student enrolled at UTokyo. For instructions on how to use UTOL as a course instructor or TA, please refer to the “[Using UTOL as a Course Instructor or TA](../lecturers/)”.

First, we will describe how to check your courses in the timetable and calendar format, and then how to view the course information as well as how to use the functions for assignments, handouts, and other materials (contents). Finally, this will explain how to list or search the contents of the courses you are taking and how to search for them.

### Notifications and Updates

The UTOL’s notification function includes “Updates”, which automatically notifies you when there are updates to course materials, and “Notifications”, which are registered by your course instructor.

You can set whether or not to receive these notifications for each course. For more information, please refer to “[Settings to receive notifications in the UTOL](../notification/)”.

### Attendance
{:#attendance}

For classes for which attendance is taken on UTOL, please register your attendance according to “[Registering attendance](#register-attendance)” below.

Please note that the method of taking attendance and managing attendance differs from class to class, so if you have any concerns about this, please consult your course instructor.

#### Registering attendance
{:#register-attendance}

![](./_img/label.png)

The label is a function that filters the contents displayed on the Course Top screen by the relevant groups. Labels must be assigned in advance by your course instructor (enrolled students cannot create or edit labels).

If you select the label you want to display from the pull-down menu at the upper part of the Course Top, only the contents with that label will be displayed. If you select “ALL”, all contents will be displayed.

Messages can only be viewed by the person you specify as a recipient or your course instructor. However, posts on the forum can be viewed by all participants in the course.

Even if you press the “Submit” button for an assignment, there may be cases where the submission process is not completed correctly due to various reasons, such as network issues, resulting in the assignment not being submitted. Please check the following when submitting:

- After submitting the assignment, make sure that the message “Submit is completed” is displayed.
  - If this message does not appear, the submission may not have been successful. Please try submitting again.
- After submission, confirm that the “Submission Status” column on the course top page shows that the assignment has been submitted, and also check that the submitted file has been uploaded by clicking on the title.

- Your course instructor can view the total results but not your comments or the names of the enrollees who have answered the survey.

### Function for No Submission Required
{:#no-submission}

The function for No Submission Required prevents assignments, quizzes or surveys that do not need to be submitted from being displayed on the “Submission status list”.

You can set everything to be all “No Submission Required” within the course or individually.
