This page explains how to use UTOL as a student enrolled at UTokyo. For instructions on how to use UTOL as a course instructor or TA, please refer to the “[Using UTOL as a Course Instructor or TA](../lecturers/)”.

First, we will describe how to check your courses in the timetable and calendar format, and then how to view the course information as well as how to use the functions for assignments, handouts, and other materials (contents). Finally, this will explain how to list or search the contents of the courses you are taking and how to search for them.
