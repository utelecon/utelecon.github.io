        * The course administrator's destination can be selected from "All instructors and TA", "All instructors", or "No Specify".

        * Select "All instructors and TA" or "All instructors" depending on your message.    
        * If you select "No Specify" for the course administrator recipient, messages will be exchanged only among students. Please note that in this case, course instructors and TAs cannot join the conversation, but course instructors can view the messages. Also, when selecting "No Specify", you must add at least one enrolled student as a recipient.
      * Specify enrolled students
        * You can add the enrolled students address by following the steps below.
