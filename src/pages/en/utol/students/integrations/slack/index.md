## Supplemental Information and Notes  

- Once the Slack integration is activated, participants of the course will be automatically invited to the associated UTokyo Slack workspace through a synchronization process that is executed hourly. Therefore, if you already use UTokyo Slack, you may be added to the workspace without you going through the process of joining.
- The workspace will automatically become inaccessible 30 days after the end of the course period.
- For precautions on using UTokyo Slack, please refer to "[Notes and details](/en/slack/#precautions)".
