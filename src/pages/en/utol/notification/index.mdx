## Overview

UTOL has a feature that allows you to send (forward) notifications to external services such as email, LINE, UTokyo Slack, etc. By setting up notifications to services you use regularly, you will be able to stay informed immediately when assignments or announcements are added.

There are two types of notifications that can be sent: “Updates notification” and “Information notices and Messages”.

### Updates notification

- This notifies you **when there are updates** to courses you are registered for.
- **Only the title** of the update will be sent. You can view details by accessing UTOL through the link attached to the notification.
- Notifications can be received via Email, LINE, and Slack.
- The following are considered as "Updates".
  - Enrolled students: when instructors add assignments, information notices, and messages.
  - **Instructors: when enrolled students submit assignments. **
- Notifications include the following information:
  - **Day and period**
  - **Course title**
  - **Course instructor name **
  - **Update details**
  - **URL of the updates**（Slack only）

- Notices include the following information.
  - **URL of the course**
  - **Day and period**
  - **Course title**
  - **Sender**

### Comparison of notification destinations

You can select multiple destinations for notifications and configure different settings for each service.

- Example: "Redirecting all information once a day for email.  Instant transfer for Slack."

A brief comparison of the available destinations is shown below.

| Destination       | Updates notification | Information/Message Notifications | Details of destination        |                                          |
| :----------- | :------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email       | ◯        | ◯                        | Any email addresses                                            |
| LINE         | △ (※1)        | ◯                        | Individual chat room with "東京大学UTOL" (Slack App)               |
| UTokyo Slack | ◯        | ×                        | Direct messages with UTOL通知" (Slack App)              |

※1. When forwarding to LINE, the "Instant transfer" of update information for assignments, course materials, quizzes, surveys, and forums are not available. Only the "Redirecting all information once a day" option is available (you can also select "Do not forward").

Settings can be configured separately for [Updates notification](#update-notification-range) (**title only**), and [Information/Message Notifications](#message-notification-range) (information notice and message **content**). However, setup options available differ between the two.

- Updates notification: destination, type, and frequency
- Information/Message Notifications: **destination only**

### Update information
{:#update-notification-range}
