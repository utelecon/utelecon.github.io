<If cond={props.variant !== "lecturer"}>

Courses for which the contents use is limited to course registration or course instructor registration will not be displayed unless the conditions for the content use are met even if the student has registered for the course. For this reason, courses that were previously displayed may no longer be displayed if the course registration deadline has passed or the conditions have changed due to a change in the settings.

For information on the conditions for using the contents, please refer to "[Notes on course registration](/utol/students/course_registration/#caution){/*TODO: リンク先確認*/}".
