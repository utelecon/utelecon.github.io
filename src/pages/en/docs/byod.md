Starting from the 2022 academic year, the University of Tokyo will implement BYOD (Bring Your Own Device: PC required), which requires students to use their own mobile PC in university classes, for incoming students. Please prepare your own PC and home network environment based on the following basic performance requirements. Please also check the information of the faculty or graduate school you are entering, as there may be special requirements for courses after the latter half of the undergraduate program. In addition to the implementation of this policy, the support will also be provided to students who have difficulty preparing their PCs for economic reasons.
