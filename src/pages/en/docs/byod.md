Starting from the 2022 academic year, the University of Tokyo will implement BYOD (Bring Your Own Device: PC required), which requires students to use their own mobile PC in university classes, for incoming students. Please prepare your own PC and home network environment based on the following basic performance requirements. Please also check the information of the faculty or graduate school you are entering, as there may be special requirements for courses after the latter half of the undergraduate program. In addition to the implementation of this policy, the support will also be provided to students who have difficulty preparing their PCs for economic reasons. 

## Basic performance requirements

- OS: Latest version of Windows or macOS (Windows 11 or macOS 14)
- CPU: Equivalent to Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen7, Qualcomm Snapdragon X, or Apple M2 or higher
- Memory: 16GB or more
- Storage: SSD 256GB or more
- Network: Wireless LAN Wi-Fi 6 or higher (IEEE802.11ax or higher)
- Display: 11 inches or larger
- Input device: Physical keyboard (detachable or separable)
- Battery life (catalog description): 15 hours or more
- External interface: Headphones and microphone can be used, camera can be used
- Data communication required at home: Communication speed of 10Mbps or higher, communication volume of 50GB/month or higher

If your environment allows you to use a PC that meets the above performance requirements at home or elsewhere, the device you bring to the university may be a tablet device (e.g., iPad OS 18) that meets the following requirements. However, if a PC is required for classes, etc., please follow the instructions.

- Must be able to use a full browser
- Must meet the same network and external interface requirements as a PC

Even if you use a PC or other device that you already own, please prepare it with reference to the performance requirements above.

## Remarks

The above requirements are only intended as a guide to the necessary performance for attending classes.

Please check for individual requirements for the following departments.
