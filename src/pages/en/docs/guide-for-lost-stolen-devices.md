Cases of device loss or theft, such as during business trips, are on the rise. If you are not properly prepared or do not take the correct actions when a device is lost, the risk of information being stolen or misused increases. Please refer to the checklist below for preventive measures and steps to take in the event of loss.

## Prevention Checklist

* [Encrypt your disk](#disk-encryption)
* [Regularly back up your data](#regular-backup)
* [Set up remote lock (Windows) or remote data wipe (macOS) in advance using the "Find" feature](#remote-lock-wipe)
* [Know the contact point and initial response procedures in case your device is lost](#contact-procedure)

## Encrypt your disk
{:#disk-encryption}

### For Windows

You can use the standard BitLocker feature in Windows to encrypt your drive. Steps to enable BitLocker:

1. Open the "Control Panel" from the Start menu.
2. Select "System and Security" and click "BitLocker Drive Encryption."
3. Choose "Turn on BitLocker."
4. When prompted to "Choose how you want to back up your recovery key," select a backup method.
   - If you choose "Save to a file," store it on a USB drive.
   - If you choose "Print the recovery key," keep the printed recovery key in a secure place, separate from your device.

   ※ In either case, ensure that the USB drive or printed paper is stored securely and separately from the device.
5. When asked to "Choose how much of your drive to encrypt," select "Encrypt entire drive."
6. For "Choose which encryption mode to use," select "New encryption mode" for internal drives, or "Compatible mode" for external drives and USBs.
7. Check "Run BitLocker system check" and proceed.
8. Follow the instructions to restart your PC; encryption will begin.

### For MacOS

You can use the standard FileVault feature in macOS to encrypt your drive. FileVault is supported on Macs with Intel CPUs (2018 and later) and Apple Silicon (M1〜M5). Steps to enable FileVault:

1. Open "System Settings" from the Apple menu, and then click "Privacy & Security."
2. Scroll down and turn on FileVault. You may be prompted to enter your password.
3. Choose a method to unlock the disk or reset your password if forgotten: 
   - iCloud account: Click "Allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk." If you're not using iCloud, set it up as prompted.
   - Recovery key: Click "Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account." Write down the recovery key and store it safely.
4. Click "Continue."

## Regular Backups
{:#regular-backup}

- Even with encryption and remote wipe settings, data on the device is not protected. Please ensure to back up your data regularly.
- In addition to local disks, you can use cloud storage services such as [Google Drive](/en/google/drive/) or [OneDrive](/en/microsoft/onedrive/), which are available through the university. Please be mindful of storage limits. In addition, data will be deleted a certain period after graduation or resignation.

## Knowing Who to Contact and What to Do if Your Device Is Lost
{:#contact-procedure}

If a device user loses their device, they should contact their supervisor or laboratory head. The supervisor or laboratory head who receives the report should then contact the departmental contact or the departmental CERT for information incidents and follow their instructions. Even if the device is eventually returned after being temporarily lost, if there is any suspicion that a third party may have accessed the device, please contact the departmental contact or the departmental CERT in the same manner.
