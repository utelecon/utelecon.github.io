  title: Request Participants to Register
---

The participant registration feature of Zoom sets the system up so that it requires prospective participants to register in advance so that only those who have registered can attend the meetings.

The meeting host creates a registration link using this feature.
Subsequently, the host sends the relevant link to prospective participants and asks them to complete the registration procedure.
Prospective participants who wish to attend the meeting are required to access the registration page provided by the host and complete the registration procedure.
Prospective participants who register are automatically approved to join the meeting on completing the procedure and receive a confirmation email containing an individualised link.
It is not possible to join the meeting unless you complete the registration process and obtain the link.


The host can check what information has been entered on the registration form by the prospective participants.
There is an option that allows the host to manually decide whether or not to approve the participation of a prospective participant who has completed the registration procedure.

## Basic Usage

Here, we will explain how the host creates a meeting where the participant registration feature is enabled and how the participants register in advance and how they attend the meeting.

### When Creating a New Meeting Requiring Participant Registration

1. Please go to the [Zoom meeting page](https://u-tokyo-ac-jp.zoom.us/meeting/) in your web browser and click on "Schedule a Meeting".
1. On the next screen, please switch on  the "Required" checkbox for "Registration".
   ![](MustRegisterCheckOn.png){:.medium} 
1. Please click on the "Save" button at the bottom.
1. Please inform prospective participants of the "Registration Link" shown below.
   ![](RegisterLink.png){:.medium}
1. Prospective participants can perform the necessary registration procedures through the "Registration Link".
   Participants who have completed the registration procedure will automatically receive a confirmation email containing the individualised link.

※For the host to be able to individually decide whether or not a prospective participant will receive the confirmation email or not, please use the "Manual Approval" option mentioned below.

### Enabling the Participant Registration Feature in an Already Created Meeting (Not Recommended)

You can change a meeting that did not require participant registration to one that requires after it has been scheduled. However, this is not recommended because if the participants have the original link instead of the registration link created after the host has applied this change, they will be able to attend the meeting without completing the registration procedure.

1. Please go to the [Zoom meeting page](https://u-tokyo-ac-jp.zoom.us/meeting/) in your web browser.
1. When you hover the mouse over the meeting which you wish to enable the participant registration feature, the "Edit" button will be displayed on the right side. Please click on this button.
   ![](ChangeToRegister.png){:.medium}
1. On the next screen, please switch on the "Required" checkbox for "Registration".
1. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom.
1. Please inform the prospective participants of the "Registration Link" displayed on the next screen.

### What Prospective Participants Need to Do

1. Please click on the "Registration Link" informed by the host.
1. The screen shown in the figure will be displayed. 
   Please enter your information in the entry fields and click on the "Register" button below. 
   In the email address field, enter your own email address. 
   Members of the University of Tokyo should enter their UTokyo Account (10-digit Common ID) followed by @utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp, e.g. `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.
   ![](RegistrationForm_new.png){:.medium}
1. Once approved by the host, a confirmation email will be sent to the entered email address. 
   An individualized link required to attend the meeting will be provided in the confirmation email. 
   Since this link is assigned individually to registered prospective participants, please make sure not to leak it to others or lose it.
1. On the day of the meeting, please click on the join link to attend the meeting.

#### If You Are Unable to Register for UTokyo Member Restricted Zoom Meetings

In spite of being a member of the University of Tokyo, if you cannot register for a meeting restricted to UTokyo members, please check the following. 
If participant registration is open to external participants as well, this step is not necessary.

-  You have not entered your UTokyo Account: Please enter your UTokyo Account (10-digit Common ID＋`@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`).
-  **You have never signed in to Zoom with your Zoom account of the University of Tokyo**： 
   If you have never logged into your account of the University of Tokyo before, it is possible that you cannot register for Zoom meetings restricted to UTokyo Member. 
   In such cases, please perform the registration procedure again after signing in following the [Sign-in Methods for Zoom](/en/zoom/signin/).

※For Hosts: This problem may occur when the "Require authentication to join" option is enabled.

## "Require authentication to join" Option

Here, we will explain the "Require authentication to join" option, which allows you to restrict registration in advance to UTokyo members. 
This is an option that only prospective participants having specific email addresses can register in advance. 
By setting so that only participants who have a UTokyo Account which have `u-tokyo.ac.jp` at the end, assigned to members of the University of Tokyo, can attend, you can restrict "Participant Registration" to UTokyo members only.

1. Please go to the [Zoom meeting page](https://u-tokyo-ac-jp.zoom.us/meeting/) in your web browser and click on "Schedule a Meeting".
1. On the following screen, please switch on the "Required" checkbox for "Registration".
1. Then, on the same screen, please switch on the "Require authentication to join" checkbox.
   ![](OnlyVerifiedUserCheckOn.png){:.medium}
1. Then select "大学アカウントとしてサインイン (Sign in with university account)" from the dropdown menu just below.
1. Please ensure that the field further down in the menu is "*.u-tokyo.ac.jp". If not, please click on next "Edit" to change it.
   ![](OnlyVerifiedUserDomain.png){:.medium}
1. Click on the "Save" button at the bottom.
1.	Please inform the prospective participants of the "Registration Link" displayed on the next screen and guide prospective participants to enter their UTokyo Account (10-digit Common ID+ `@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`), e. g. `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp` in the email address field.
   ![](RegisterLink.png){:.medium}

※If the email addresses of prospective participants are not in the format of `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`, you may still be able to register in the Zoom system (if you have the Zoom account with `u-tokyo.ac.jp` at the end). 
However, because using the UTokyo Account (10-digit Common ID+`@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`) as the Zoom account is standard at the University of Tokyo, please enter in the format of `0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp`.

## Resending Confirmation Email
