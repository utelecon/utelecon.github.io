By scheduling recurring meetings, you can use a fixed meeting URL with all 13 class occurrences. 
Note that the advanced settings of recurring meetings can be configured only in the Zoom Meetings page **on your web browser**.
First, open <a href="https://zoom.us/profile" target="_blank">the Zoom profile page</a> and sign into your Zoom account. Click “SCHEDULE” in the upper right corner.
In the meeting settings page, you will see the option “Recurring meeting”. If this option is selected, you can hold recurring meetings with the same meeting URL.

Please refer to the following video (Japanese only) for detailed instructions.
