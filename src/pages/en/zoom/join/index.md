In this section we explain how to join a meeting room.  
There are two available ways: using a URL（`https://zoom.us/j/xxxxxxxxxx` x are numbers）provided by the host; or entering a 9-10 digits ID also provided by the host.



## Joining with a URL
1. Access the meeting room URL (`https://zoom.us/j/xxxxxxxxxx` x are numbers）
1. Press "Open Zoom Meetings" on the Web browser (if Zoom is yet not installed, you can download and install it from this screen)
