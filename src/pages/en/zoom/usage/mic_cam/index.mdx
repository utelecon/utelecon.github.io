## Introduction

This page mainly explains how to use Zoom's audio (voice function) and video features. 
As this page is quite long, please refer to the table of contents to find the sections you are interested in rather than reading the entire page. 
The overall flow is as follows.

* [How to use the audio](#audio-usage)
* [How to use the video](#video-usage)
* [About the test function](#test)
* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

First, we will explain how to use the audio and video functions in Zoom, dividing it into during the meetings and outside of meetings.
Then, we will explain the test function, which allows you to check whether or not you are using each function properly. 
If a problem occurs, you can use the test function to identify the cause of the problem. 
If you encounter a problem while using Zoom on your PC, please try the test function. 
Finally, we will explain how to solve problems in the troubleshooting section.

## How to use the audio
{:#audio-usage}

In this section, we explain how to use the Zoom audio, separating it by usage situation.

### Operating the audio when joining a meeting

#### PC

When joining a meeting, a screen may appear asking you to select how you want to connect your audio. 
If the following screen appears, click the “Join with computer audio” button. 
If you check the box at the bottom of the screen that says “Automatically join audio by computer when joining,” this screen will no longer appear. 
Therefore, if this screen does not appear, audio will be connected automatically.

#### Smartphones

When joining a meeting, a screen may appear asking you to select how you want to connect your audio. 
If the following screen appears, press the “WiFi or cellular data” button. 
If this screen does not appear, audio is connected automatically.

### Operating the audio during a meeting

#### Mute/Unmute
{:#mute-unmute}

You can mute or unmute your microphone by clicking on the microphone icon labeled “Audio” in the lower-left corner of the window. 
When muted, a red slash will appear on the microphone icon.

If the headphone icon appears with the words “Connect to audio” instead of the microphone icon, the audio is not enabled and the audio function cannot be used. 
To use audio, press the headphone icon and select “Join with computer audio” on a PC or “WiFi or cellular data” on a smartphone from the screen that appears.

#### Switching between microphone and speakers

In the Zoom app for PC, if there are multiple speakers and microphones connected to your PC, such as built-in and external ones, you can select the ones you want to use. 
The following explains how to configure the settings.

Press the upward arrow to the right of the microphone icon in the lower left corner of the window and a list of connected microphones will be displayed under the “Select a microphone” item. 
Select the microphone you wish to use. The same applies for speakers. 
If you select “Same as system”, the same microphone as the computer settings will be used. 
Therefore, changing the computer settings will also change the settings in Zoom. Basically, selecting the default setting “Same as system” will suffice.

#### Disconnecting the audio

If you are joining a Zoom meeting but do not need to communicate by voice, you can leave the audio and turn off the audio function. 
For example, when you disconnect the audio, your voice will no longer be heard by other participants, and you will also be unable to hear the voices of other participants. 
The following explains how to operate each device.


##### PC
Press the upward arrow to the right of the microphone icon to display a menu, then select “Leave computer audio”.

#### Operations that can only be performed by the host or co-host

If you are the host or co-host of a meeting, you can mute other participants during the meeting or unmute them.

* **Muting other participants**：To mute a specific participant, click on the icon labeled “Participants” on your PC, select the name of the participant you want to mute from the list of participants that appears, and click “Mute”.
  * For smartphones, press the name of the participant you want to mute, then press “Mute” in the display that appears.
* **Unmuting other participants**：To unmute a specific participant, click the “Participants” tab on your PC, place the cursor over the name of the participant you want to unmute, and click “Ask to unmute”. When you ask to a participant to unmute, a screen will appear on the participant’s screen asking them to choose whether to unmute or remain muted.
  * For smartphones, tap the name of the participant you want to unmute, then tap “Ask to unmute” in the display that appears.

You can also use the host tool to set whether or not to allow participants to use the video function or to be able to unmute themselves. 
The host tools icon is displayed at the bottom of the screen on a PC, and on a smartphone, you can access it by tapping “More” ➝ “Host tools” at the bottom of the screen.

### Setting up the audio
{:#setup-for-meeting}

Here, we explain the audio settings that are considered useful.

#### Settings when joining a meeting

##### PC

You can configure your audio settings in the “Meetings & webinars” and “Audio” tab of the settings screen that appears when you tap the gear icon in the upper right corner of the application’s Home tab. 
Here, we will explain these settings.

![](img/audio/settings.png){:.center.border}
![](img/audio/settings-audio.png){:.small.center.border}

* **Automatically connect to computer audio when joining (Meetings & Webinars tab)**：Checking this option will prevent you from being prompted to connect to audio each time you join a meeting.
  * On macOS, “Automatically connect to Computer Audio when joining” will be displayed.
* **Mute microphone when joining (Meeting & Webinar tab)**：Checking this option will mute your microphone from the start when you join a meeting. This reduces the chance of accidentally speaking during the meeting.
* **Background noise suppression (Audio tab)**：This feature suppresses sounds other than participants' voices. There are four options: “Auto”, “Low”, “Medium”, and “High”. Generally, the default “Auto” setting is sufficient. If voices become difficult to hear with “Auto,” adjust the setting.

##### Smartphones

Tap the profile icon in the upper-left corner of the application’s Home tab, then tap “Settings” within it. 
Then, tap “Meeting” to configure audio and video settings during the meeting.

* Auto-connect to audio: Enabling this feature prevents the system from asking you to connect audio each time you join a meeting. Selecting “WiFi or cellular data” is sufficient.
