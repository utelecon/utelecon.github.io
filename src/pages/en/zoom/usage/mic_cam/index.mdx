### Operating the audio when joining a meeting

#### PC

When joining a meeting, a screen may appear asking you to select how you want to connect your audio. 
If the following screen appears, click the “Join with computer audio” button. 
If you check the box at the bottom of the screen that says “Automatically join audio by computer when joining,” this screen will no longer appear. 
Therefore, if this screen does not appear, audio will be connected automatically.
