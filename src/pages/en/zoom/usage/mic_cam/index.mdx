## Introduction

This page mainly explains how to use Zoom's audio (voice function) and video features. 
As this page is quite long, please refer to the table of contents to find the sections you are interested in rather than reading the entire page. 
The overall flow is as follows.

* [How to use the audio](#audio-usage)
* [How to use the video](#video-usage)
* [About the test function](#test)
* [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

First, we will explain how to use the audio and video functions in Zoom, dividing it into during the meetings and outside of meetings.
Then, we will explain the test function, which allows you to check whether or not you are using each function properly. 
If a problem occurs, you can use the test function to identify the cause of the problem. 
If you encounter a problem while using Zoom on your PC, please try the test function. 
Finally, we will explain how to solve problems in the troubleshooting section.

## How to use the audio
{:#audio-usage}

In this section, we explain how to use the Zoom audio, separating it by usage situation.

### Operating the audio when joining a meeting

#### PC

When joining a meeting, a screen may appear asking you to select how you want to connect your audio. 
If the following screen appears, click the “Join with computer audio” button. 
If you check the box at the bottom of the screen that says “Automatically join audio by computer when joining,” this screen will no longer appear. 
Therefore, if this screen does not appear, audio will be connected automatically.

![](img/audio/join-by-pc.png){:.small.center}



#### Smartphones

When joining a meeting, a screen may appear asking you to select how you want to connect your audio. 
If the following screen appears, press the “WiFi or cellular data” button. 
If this screen does not appear, audio is connected automatically.

![](img/audio/join-by-phone.png){:.small.center}


### Operating the audio during a meeting

#### Mute/Unmute
{:#mute-unmute}

You can mute or unmute your microphone by clicking on the microphone icon labeled “Audio” in the lower-left corner of the window. 
When muted, a red slash will appear on the microphone icon.

If the headphone icon appears with the words “Connect to audio” instead of the microphone icon, the audio is not enabled and the audio function cannot be used. 
To use audio, press the headphone icon and select “Join with computer audio” on a PC or “WiFi or cellular data” on a smartphone from the screen that appears.

![](img/audio/mute-unmute.png)

#### Switching between microphone and speakers

In the Zoom app for PC, if there are multiple speakers and microphones connected to your PC, such as built-in and external ones, you can select the ones you want to use. 
The following explains how to configure the settings.

Press the upward arrow to the right of the microphone icon in the lower left corner of the window and a list of connected microphones will be displayed under the “Select a microphone” item. 
Select the microphone you wish to use. The same applies for speakers. 
If you select “Same as system”, the same microphone as the computer settings will be used. 
Therefore, changing the computer settings will also change the settings in Zoom. Basically, selecting the default setting “Same as system” will suffice.
