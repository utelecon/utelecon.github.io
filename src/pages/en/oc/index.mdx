## Greetings

Welcome to all new students!

The University of Tokyo will mainly conduct face-to-face classes in the academic year 2023 with the necessary infection prevention measures in place. On the other hand, hybrid classes, which combine face-to-face and online presence in classes, or online-only classes will also be offered when it is possible to enhance the educational effect. In addition, the use of digital technology is progressing even in face-to-face classes, and there are many situations in which information systems are used, such as the electronic distribution of materials and submission of assignments. We would like to ask you to be ready to use the necessary information systems so that you can participate in the classes smoothly. Please prepare a laptop computer that you can bring with you, and complete the initial setup of your account and various tools. The university will continue to improve the environment for your productive activities on campus, such as updating and enhancing the Wi-Fi throughout the university and making it available in most parts of the campus during the academic years 2022 and 2023.

While digital technology is being used widely in the society these days, the University of Tokyo is also making progress in its Digital Transformation (DX) initiatives. Digital technologies such as chat tools and web conferencing have made it easier for people to interact and collaborate with each other at a distance, and have greatly changed the form of communication. However, there are still some uncertainties about how to introduce new technologies into university activities. We would like to take on the challenge of creating the next generation of education together with you, the students, and hope that you will actively participate in our efforts.

This portal site, "utelecon," aggregates information on the system at the University of Tokyo. First of all, please check the necessary preparations for taking classes. We also introduce the advanced usage of various tools, so we hope that you will make use of this site not only for classes, but also for your own activities such as study groups and circle activities. If you have any problems or difficulties, please feel free to ask questions at the support desk.

We, the faculty and staff of the university, are committed to meeting your expectations for face-to-face classes and campus activities, while placing the highest priority on protecting your health and ensuring your study opportunities. We will do our best to make your studies as effective and fulfilling as possible.

## Class Format at UTokyo

At the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), classes are offered in a wide range of formats, including face-to-face and online. Face-to-face classes are conventional classes held in classrooms, and online classes are classes in which students can participate without being in the classroom using web conferencing systems for example. Please check with the faculty, graduate school or the instructor in charge of the class to find out which format the class will be in.

### Online Classes

There are various types of online classes, but the main type of online class at UTokyo is the "**simultaneous, interactive**" type. This is a form of real-time interactive communication between the teacher and students using applications such as Zoom and Webex, types of web conferencing systems that allow audio and video exchanges. The preparations necessary for using the systems are explained in this page.

Other forms include "**on-demand**" type, where students watch video recordings of classes and ask questions and discuss them via email or chat tools, and the "**hybrid**" type, where online classes are combined with face-to-face classes in the classroom. 

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes

### Use of Various Information Systems

You will be using a variety of information systems during your classes at UTokyo. You should set up an account and practice all the relevant procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a list of these systems. The detailed procedures are explained in the subsequent sections:
