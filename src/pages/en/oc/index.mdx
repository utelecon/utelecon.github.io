## Greetings

Welcome to all new students!

The University of Tokyo is promoting the use of digital technology in education, and information systems will be used in a variety of situations, such as the electronic distribution of materials and submission of assignments. We would like to ask you to be ready to use the necessary information systems so that you can participate in the classes smoothly. Please prepare a laptop computer that you can bring with you, and complete the initial setup of your account and various tools.

Nowadays, the information security environment has become very severe in recent years, partly due to the worsening social situation. We have a lot of critical information, such as information related to cutting-edge research, and ensuring its security is a serious issue. Although our university is taking the necessary measures, we need your cooperation to protect our information, as a university account you will be using is one of the entrances to access information within the university. In particular, we have introduced a "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)" system that requires users to sign in using a smartphone or other device in addition to a password, and we would like everyone to use this system. This is included as part of the initial setup procedure, so please make sure to do it. We also offer a course called "Information Security Education", which you are requested to attend.

The use of IT is spreading throughout society, and in the past year or so, generative AI, as represented by ChatGPT, has been a hot topic of discussion. The University of Tokyo appreciates its positive aspects and will not uniformly prohibit the use of generative AI tools, and we will actively explore its potential applications to education and research. Students are encouraged to take the opportunity to try it out. On the other hand, please understand that the process of learning at a university is not only about the result of acquiring knowledge and submitting a product, but also about the process of thinking for oneself and improving one's ability, so it is meaningless to use AI simply to make things easier. For details, please refer to the guideline "[Policy on the use of AI tools in classes](/en/docs/ai-tools-in-classes)". We also published a message "[生成系AIについて (About generative AI)](/docs/20230403-generative-ai)" (only in Japanese) last year, so please refer to it as well. There are still some uncertainties about how to incorporate new technologies into university activities, so we would like to take on the challenge of creating the next generation of education together with students. We hope that you will actively participate in our efforts.

This portal site, "utelecon," aggregates information on the system at the University of Tokyo. First of all, please check the necessary preparations for taking classes. We also introduce the advanced usage of various tools such as chat tools and web conferencing, so we hope that you will make use of this site not only for classes, but also for your own activities such as study groups and circle activities, as well as in dialogue and collaboration with others around you. If you have any problems or difficulties, please feel free to ask questions at the support desk.

The University of Tokyo is making necessary improvements to achieve synergy between the campus environment and the ICT environment. For example, the renewal and enhancement of Wi-Fi covering most of the campus is scheduled to be completed in the first half of this academic year. We, the faculty and staff of the university, will do our best to make your studies as effective and fulfilling as possible.

## Class Format at UTokyo

At the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), classes are offered in a wide range of formats, including face-to-face and online. Face-to-face classes are conventional classes held in classrooms, and online classes are classes in which students can participate without being in the classroom using web conferencing systems for example. Please check with the faculty, graduate school or the instructor in charge of the class to find out which format the class will be in.

### Online Classes

There are various types of online classes, but the main type of online class at UTokyo is the "**simultaneous, interactive**" type. This is a form of real-time interactive communication between the teacher and students using applications such as Zoom and Webex, types of web conferencing systems that allow audio and video exchanges. The preparations necessary for using the systems are explained in this page.

Other forms include "**on-demand**" type, where students watch video recordings of classes and ask questions and discuss them via email or chat tools, and the "**hybrid**" type, where online classes are combined with face-to-face classes in the classroom. 

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes
