## Greetings

Welcome to all new students!

The University of Tokyo will mainly conduct face-to-face classes in the academic year 2023 with the necessary infection prevention measures in place. On the other hand, hybrid classes, which combine face-to-face and online presence in classes, or online-only classes will also be offered when it is possible to enhance the educational effect. In addition, the use of digital technology is progressing even in face-to-face classes, and there are many situations in which information systems are used, such as the electronic distribution of materials and submission of assignments. We would like to ask you to be ready to use the necessary information systems so that you can participate in the classes smoothly. Please prepare a laptop computer that you can bring with you, and complete the initial setup of your account and various tools. The university will continue to improve the environment for your productive activities on campus, such as updating and enhancing the Wi-Fi throughout the university and making it available in most parts of the campus during the academic years 2022 and 2023.

While digital technology is being used widely in the society these days, the University of Tokyo is also making progress in its Digital Transformation (DX) initiatives. Digital technologies such as chat tools and web conferencing have made it easier for people to interact and collaborate with each other at a distance, and have greatly changed the form of communication. However, there are still some uncertainties about how to introduce new technologies into university activities. We would like to take on the challenge of creating the next generation of education together with you, the students, and hope that you will actively participate in our efforts.

This portal site, "utelecon," aggregates information on the system at the University of Tokyo. First of all, please check the necessary preparations for taking classes. We also introduce the advanced usage of various tools, so we hope that you will make use of this site not only for classes, but also for your own activities such as study groups and circle activities. If you have any problems or difficulties, please feel free to ask questions at the support desk.

We, the faculty and staff of the university, are committed to meeting your expectations for face-to-face classes and campus activities, while placing the highest priority on protecting your health and ensuring your study opportunities. We will do our best to make your studies as effective and fulfilling as possible.

## Class Format at the University of Tokyo

At the University of Tokyo, classes are offered in a wide range of formats, including face-to-face and online. Face-to-face classes are conventional classes held in classrooms, and online classes are classes in which students can participate without being in the classroom using web conferencing systems for example. Please check with the faculty, the graduate school or the instructor in charge of the class to find out in which format the class will be held.

### Online Classes

There are various types of online classes, but the main type of online class at the University of Tokyo is the "**simultaneous interactive**" type. This is a form of real-time interactive communication between the teacher and students using applications such as Zoom and Webex, a type of web conferencing system that allows audio and video exchange. The necessary preparations for using the system are explained in this page.

Other forms include the "**on-demand**" type, in which students watch video recordings of classes and ask questions and discuss them via email or chat tools, and the "**hybrid**" type , in which online classes are combined with face-to-face classes in the classroom.

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes

### Use of Various Information Systems

You will be using a variety of information systems during your classes at UTokyo. You should set up an account and practice all procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a list of these systems. The detailed procedures are explained in the subsequent sections:

export const about_utokyo_account =
  "This is the account you will use to log into UTokyo’s ICT systems. The username may also be referred to as “Common ID”.";
export const about_utas =
  "This system is used to browse the syllabus for each class, register courses, and check the grades (academic affairs system).";
export const about_itc_lms =
  "This system is used to download class material and submit assignments (learning management system).";
export const about_zoom =
  'This is a web conferencing system that are used for "simultaneous interactive" online classes. ';
export const about_google =
  "This is a UTokyo Google account that allows users to use Google services, such as Gmail, as a UTokyo member. The ECCS Cloud Email can also be used as a UTokyo email address. Since some UTokyo web pages can only be accessed by UTokyo members, you are required to activate your ECCS Cloud Email even if you already own a Google account.";
export const about_microsoft =
  "This is a Microsoft license offered to UTokyo Account holders. This license will enable you to download Microsoft Office apps, such as Word and Excel, and use online Microsoft tools for free with the UTokyo Account. Similar to Google Workspace, some UTokyo webpages can only be accessed with a UTokyo Account. Therefore, it is necessary to use your UTokyo Account even if you already own a Microsoft account.";
export const about_utokyo_wifi =
  "Wi-Fi services are available on campus. You will require them while taking online classes on campus. Please note that you will not be able to use Wi-Fi services unless you have created an account in advance.";
export const about_eccs =
  "ECCS terminals refer to the computers installed on campus. You can use them while taking online classes on campus. You also use them in some face-to-face classes. Please note that you need to apply for the right of use in advance.";
