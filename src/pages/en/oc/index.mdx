## Class Format at UTokyo

At the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), classes are offered in a wide range of formats, including face-to-face and online. Face-to-face classes are conventional classes held in classrooms, and online classes are classes in which students can participate without being in the classroom using web conferencing systems for example. Please check with the faculty, graduate school or the instructor in charge of the class to find out which format the class will be in.

### Online Classes

There are various types of online classes, but the main type of online class at UTokyo is the "**simultaneous, interactive**" type. This is a form of real-time interactive communication between the teacher and students using applications such as Zoom and Webex, types of web conferencing systems that allow audio and video exchanges. The preparations necessary for using the systems are explained in this page.

Other forms include "**on-demand**" type, where students watch video recordings of classes and ask questions and discuss them via email or chat tools, and the "**hybrid**" type, where online classes are combined with face-to-face classes in the classroom. 

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes

### Use of Various Information Systems

You will be using a variety of information systems during your classes at UTokyo. You should set up an account and practice all the relevant procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a list of these systems. The detailed procedures are explained in the subsequent sections:

{/* 以下の説明の文章は後でも使うため，一度変数として定義してからそれを呼び出す形で記述している */}
export const about_utokyo_account =
  <>This is the account used for the University of Tokyo's information systems. The UTokyo Account follows the format 10-digit common ID followed by the domain indicating the University of Tokyo, such as <code>0123456789@utac.u-tokyo.ac.jp</code>. </>
export const about_utas =
  "This system allows you to browse the syllabus for each class, register courses, and check your grades (academic affairs system).";
export const about_utol =

### Network Environment and Electronic Devices

To take classes, you will need an Internet connection and equipment such as a computer. The following is an explanation of what and how you will need to prepare.

- **Network connection**: There should be no problem with slower connections as long as you can watch videos stably. However, pay attention to your usage communication capacity when taking long online classes. More specifically, if you are using a smartphone directly connected to a mobile network (e.g., LTE), please ensure that you do not run out of data.
  - The university provides Wi-Fi on campus.
  {/* <!--    - The University of Tokyo provides support for new students who do not have adequate network connections. For more details, please check “[The network environment support for education and research](/mobile/)”. --> */}
- **PC**: You will often need a computer for writing reports, and also when you do some work or exercises while watching videos.
  - A portable laptop is recommended so that you can use it on campus.
  - For specifications, please refer to “[東京大学の BYOD 方針](/docs/byod) (UTokyo's BYOD Policy)” (in Japanese).
    {/* <!-- - (For first-year undergraduate students) The College of Arts and Sciences provides guidelines for required PC specifications in “オンライン授業に必要な機器や通学前の準備について(Devices necessary for online classes and preparation for attending college)” (in Japanese). --> */}
    - We recommend that you buy a computer with a microphone and a camera. However, if your computer does not already have them, you can buy external cameras and microphones when you need them.
  - You can also refer to the University Co-op’s special topic page about computers for new students, “[受験生・新入生応援サイト 2025 駒場モデルパソコン](https://text.univ.coop/puk/START/utcoop/pc.html) (Komaba Model PC for Examinees and New Students Support Site)” (in Japanese).
  - If you do not have a computer that meets the above-mentioned specifications, please consult with your faculty or graduate school (For example, the College of Arts and Sciences can [lend out computers](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/campuslife/online-lectures.html) (information in Japanese)).
- **Headset and earphones**: When taking online classes in a free classroom on campus, you will need a headset or earphones to listen to the class without disturbing other students in the same classroom. A headset equipped with a microphone is recommended when purchasing one.

## When You Need help

If you have any problems, difficulties, or concerns on using information systems, please consult the **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support/)**. Common Supporters (student staff) and faculty members will assist you in solving any problem you may have.
