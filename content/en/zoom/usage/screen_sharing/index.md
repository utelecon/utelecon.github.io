## (For teachers) Settings and notes for screen sharing

Settings and notes for screen sharing are summarized as follows.

### Privacy considerations for screen sharing
When you share your desktop, your personal information may be revealed unintentionally. To prevent such a situation, you can share the screen by window.

### Displaying meeting controls during screen sharing
The meeting controls may be hidden at the top or bottom of the window during screen sharing. To display the controls, hover the mouse cursor over the green “You are screen sharing” notification, which is next to “Stop Share” of the in-meeting menu .

### Stop student’s full screen display
During screen sharing, the student's PC screen is basically full screen, and the student cannot move to other windows. If the student double-clicks on the Zoom screen, the screen is no longer full-screen, which is easier to move to other windows.<br>
If you want the students to use other windows other than Zoom while the teacher’s screen sharing, it is better to instruct them to double-click the Zoom screen.
