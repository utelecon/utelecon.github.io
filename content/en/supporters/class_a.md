What is a Class Supporter?
---------------------------

Every undergraduate / graduate student and postdoctoral researcher belonging to the University of Tokyo can become Class Supporters. The job of Class Supporters is to support the lecturers' online courses. If you are interested in availing the Class Supporer, please read carefully the text below to understand the system of the class supporter.  

Aims and the Goal of Class Supporters
---------------------------

* Class Supporters are NOT a TA. We do not expect that Class Supporters  work hard as well as TAs are supposed to do.
* We aim to match the lectures and the Class Supporters as soon as possible.
* We also aim to make interdisciplinary connections through the system of the Class supporter.
* The budget of the Class supporter system is independently of any departments. Therefore, all lecturers can be  allocated to the Class Supporter without any budget restrictions of their department.
* The lectures can hire both Class Supporters and TAs. However, if there are TAs already at your online class, the Class Supporters may not be necessary.  

The Work for Class Supporter (Examples of the expected work)
---------------------------

* The Class Supporter will <font color="green">prepare for the online classes and/or the hybrid classes with the lecturers</font> outside of class hours. Here is  the example below:
  * check the audio settings
  * check how the camera works
  * check how the screen works when using online meeting systems.
  * communicate how the hybrid class carries out with the lectures.
* Class Supporters will <font color="green">intervene</font> when you find some fundamental troubles at your class as follows: 
  * If class supporters realize the lecturers mute, please say "Teacher, I cannot hear your voice/ see your shared screen. Please unmute/ reset your shared screen." 
  * Checking chat sent by the students. (Depending on the class style) 
  * The job of class supporters, in a word, is to prevent from occuring the worst case of happening (e.g. the lecturers spoke 30 minutes without noticing theri unmute)
  * The Class Supporter masters the very fundamental troubleshooting on the online conference systems.  
* <font color="green">Collecting information regarding online conference systems and sharing with it, if the Class Supporter affard to do．</font> For example:
  * The Class Supporter "I received the notification of  the Zoom update last night."
  * The Class Supporter "I found information at utelecon."
* <span style="color: red">Hybrid classes that require class supporters to come to school should take in consideration whether the class supporter student can commute to campus or not.<u></u></span>
  
* Caution: As a premise,<font color="green">the amount of work as class supporters should not be hard </font>and, therefore, the class supporter should be able to take classes as well as a student.

List of non-expected duties as a Class Supporter
---------------------------

* We do not expect that Class Supporters master anything about the online conference systems. Therefore, <font color="red">the lecturers should understand the online conference systems and know how to set the systems</font>.<u></u>
* We do not expect that Class Supporters to<font color="red">take a  movie and follow the lecturers move </font>in front of the blackboard<u>.</u>
* We do not expect that Class Supporters <font color="red">cope with all troubleshooting on the online conference system</font> (e.g. Some students cannot enter the online classroom or cannot hear the lectures voice)<u>.</u>(Of course, we do not think that the lecturers should cope with all troubles at the online classroom<u>.</u>)

What the Class Supporters duty  is  (1) to prepare for the online classes with the lecturers and (2) to cope with the problems if the lecturers do not notice them (e.g. Audio trouble, forget to unmute).If the lecturers want Class Supporters to do some more duties, please consent to the Class Supporter or hire another person as a TA. Lecturers should not ask the duties no more than 10 hours including 2 hour training sessions.

    *  After approving, we will send two types of forms to lectures. One is to confirm how to undergo the payment, so that the students must fill in the form. The students who become a Class Supporter also have this form but please ask them whether they fill in and submit the form. Another is to report to notify the completion of the Class Supporters' duty. The lecturer should fill in this form after finishing their duty.
1. Please submit the latter form after finishing their job because we cannot pay for a Class Supporters reward unless the lectures submit this form.
