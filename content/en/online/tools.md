## Learning Management Systems
{:#lms}

A “learning management system” is a system that supports the exchange of data and information between students and instructors in a class (e.g. distribution of materials, submission of assignments).

### ITC-LMS
ITC-LMS is UTokyo’s learning management system. It provides functions such as distribution of class materials, submission of assignments, online examinations, and notifications from faculty members to students. One of ITC-LMS’s advantages is that it is **easy to pass information "only to the students of UTokyo '' or "only to the students of a specific class"** because ITC-LMS is linked to the UTokyo Account and UTokyo Academic Affairs System (UTAS, UTokyo’s course registration system). ITC-LMS is also **widely used by students**, so we recommend that you make ITC-LMS the first choice for distributing class materials and exchanging assignments.
