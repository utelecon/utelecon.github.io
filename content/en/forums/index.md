title: Mailing List for Announcements and QA Forum
---

(March 2022) The mailing list for announcements and the QA forum described on this page are currently rarely used, so we will shut them down gradually.

- Registration for them via subscription form or e-mail has been closed.
- Announcements will be made through the UTokyo Portal (for faculty and staff) and UTAS (for students).
- Use the [Technical Support Desk](/en/support/) for inquiries.

## Introduction

We have created the following QA forums and mailing lists:

* [Mailing List for Announcements (utelecon-announce)](https://groups.google.com/a/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/g/utelecon-announce-group)
* [QA Forum (utelecon-questions)](https://groups.google.com/a/g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/g/utelecon-questions-group): Forum for questions, discussions
