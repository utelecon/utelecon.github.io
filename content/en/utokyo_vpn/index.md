title: UTokyo VPN

## Introduction
{:#introduction}

UTokyo VPN is a VPN service available to all the faculties and staff of University of Tokyo. When a device is connected to the UTokyo VPN from outside the campus, the device communicates via the VPN gateway installed at the Information Technology Center. Thereafter, the device virtually connects to the UTNET - the University of Tokyo campus network.

To use UTokyo VPN, first install AnyConnect, a VPN client application, on your device. When the installed application is launched, it connects to the VPN gateway through the UTokyo Account authentication process, allowing communication from the device to the outside world through UTNET via VPN.

### Access to e-journals
{:#journal}

You cannot access e-journals and e-books subscribed by the University of Tokyo Library via UTokyo VPN.  Instead use EZProxy to access these e-journals and e-books.  To quickly download the pdf of a paper from the publisher's landing page, it's convenient to [Read using the bookmarklet](https://www.lib.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/library/literacy/user-guide/campus/offcampus/ezproxy/others#marklet), also explained in [this page](https://note.com/k_yamamoto/n/n0ee13fe38f24) (in Japanese).  There are of course papers not subscribed by the library, as well as papers subscribed but cannot be obtained by this method.  For more details about the usage and eligible users, be sure to read the page "[Using EZproxy](https://www.lib.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/library/literacy/user-guide/campus/offcampus/ezproxy)" and "[Supplement : How to read paper found outside the university](https://www.lib.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/library/literacy/user-guide/campus/offcampus/ezproxy/others)" provided by the library.
