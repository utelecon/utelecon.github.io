## Introduction

Congratulations to all the new students!

In AY2022, we plan to provide education incorporating face-to-face classes as much as possible, while taking sufficient infection prevention measures. On the other hand, the online classes realized as a countermeasure against coronavirus infections have shown educational effects that cannot be obtained in conventional face-to-face lectures. Therefore, the University of Tokyo plans to construct a new educational system and improve its educational activities by actively incorporating online classes into its teaching methods.

This year, we will introduce BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), which allows students to bring their own laptops and other devices to the university for study. Recommended specifications will be provided in advance, so please prepare your own laptop computer and other devices for class. The University of Tokyo is continuing to improve the ICT environment on campus, including the installation of a Wi-Fi environment and more power supplies amid the Corona disaster. In addition, we are developing hybrid classes and teaching methods using virtual reality (virtual reality space). With these new initiatives, we intend to further enhance our traditional face-to-face classes and proactively incorporate next-generation educational systems that take advantage of digital transformation (DX). These initiatives are a challenge for the University of Tokyo, and we hope that not only faculty members but also participating students will actively participate in them with the spirit of ushering in a new era.

For an overview of these efforts, the University of Tokyo has set up an online class portal site called utelecon (https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), which you are encouraged to visit frequently. The site also includes a chat window for questions, as well as a function to collect opinions, requests, and ideas from faculty, staff, and students. You will also find a variety of information, including past experiences, ideas, and FAQs. This page will help you get started smoothly with your university activities.

Our faculty and staff are committed to accommodating your wishes so that you can comfortably attend face-to-face classes and campus activities, while placing the highest priority on protecting your health and ensuring that you have the opportunity to study. We will do our best to ensure that you can effectively pursue the studies you desire and lead a fulfilling student life.

## What type of online classes will be held at the University of Tokyo?

There are various types of online classes, but the "**simultaneous interactive**" type is mainly adopted at the University of Tokyo for which real time teacher-student interaction is performed with a web conference system application through audio and video exchanges. You can use this system to connect with dozens or hundreds of people in a class. The necessary preparations for using the system are explained in this page.

Apart from the aforementioned type of online classes, there is the "**on-demand**" type which students watch video recordings of classes, ask questions and discuss the contents via e-mail or chat tools. The "**hybrid**" type combines online classes with face-to-face instruction. It is noted that classes at the University of Tokyo are not online-only, some face-to-face instruction also remains. Owing to that students might have to take online classes in empty classrooms on campus before or after their face-to-face classes, depending on their timetable constraints.

## What You Need to Prepare for Classes

### Use of Various Information Systems

You will be using a variety of information systems during your classes at UTokyo. You should set up an account and practice all procedures for using these systems in advance. Below is a list of these systems. The detailed procedures are explained in the subsequent sections:

### Network Environment and Electronic Devices

To take online classes, you will need an Internet connection and equipment such as a computer. The following is an explanation of how you will need to prepare.

- **Network connection**: There should be no problem with slower connections as long as you can watch videos stably. However, pay attention to the communication capacity when taking long online classes. More specifically, if you are using a smartphone directly connected to a mobile network (e.g., LTE), please ensure that you do not run out of data.
    - The university provides Wi-Fi on campus.
<!--    - The University of Tokyo provides support for new students who do not have adequate network connections. For more details, please check “[The network environment support for education and research](/mobile/)”. -->
- **PC**: A smartphone should be sufficient if you just want to watch online classes. However, in university, you will often need a computer for many purposes, such as writing reports. In online classes, you will also need to do some work or exercises while watching videos.
    - A portable laptop is recommended so that you can use it on campus.
    - For specifications, please refer to “[東京大学のBYOD方針](/docs/byod) (The University of Tokyo's BYOD Policy)” (in Japanese).
    <!-- - (For first-year undergraduate students) The College of Arts and Sciences provides guidelines for required PC specifications in “オンライン授業に必要な機器や通学前の準備について(Devices necessary for online classes and preparation for attending college)” (in Japanese). -->
    - You may also refer to the Co-op’s special topic page about computers for new students, “[受験生・新入生応援サイト2022 駒場モデルパソコン](https://text.univ.coop/puk/START/utcoop/pc.html) (Komaba Model PC for Examinees and New Students Support Site)” (in Japanese).
    - If you do not have a computer that meets the above mentioned requirements, please consult with your faculty or graduate school. (For example, the College of Arts and Sciences can [lend out computers](https://www.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/campuslife/online-lectures.html) (in Japanese).)
- **Headset and earphones**: When taking online classes in an empty classroom on campus, you will need a headset or earphones to listen to the class without disturbing other students in the same classroom. A headset equipped with a microphone is recommended when purchasing one.

### Class Location Information

To participate in a “simultaneous interactive” online class, you will need to know the URL of the web conference. This information is normally posted in the “Online course information” section of the ITC-LMS introduced above. However, depending on the class, the lecturer may inform you of the URL through other means. Please refer to the “[How to Obtain the Online Class URL (for Students)](url)” regarding other ways of obtaining the URL.

## When You Need help

If you have any problems, difficulties, or concerns regarding online classes, please consult the **[Technical Support Desk](/en/support/)**. Common Supporters (student staff) and faculty members will assist you in solving any problem you may have.

For example, the following questions and consultations are welcome.

- “I followed the preparation procedures described on this guide, but they did not work.”
- “I have a last-minute problem when trying to participate in an online class.”
- “I am unable to download class materials.”
