- Once the account has been reissued, enter the user ID and password for the new account into the device you use and connect to it.
    - If the device remembers your previous UTokyo WiFi account information and you are not able to change it (i.e., screen to enter a new user ID and password does not appear), please delete your Wi-Fi account information on the device. The specific method of the removal varies depending on the OS and device type, so please refer to the manual of the respective device.
