## What is Slido?

Slido is a web service that provides features such as Q&A, live polling, and surveys for interactive communication with participants in classes, conferences, and lectures.

Teachers can receive questions from students (Q&A) and ask students questions (live polling) in classes. Slido has the following advantages over Zoom chat.

- Students can post questions anonymously, making it easier for them to ask questions.
- Students can "like" questions that others have posted, so they can see which questions are of high interest among peers.
- You can reply to each question individually, so that you can avoid the confusion of mixing up multiple questions (this may be useful, for example, when teaching assistants answer questions in writing).

Slido can also be used as a bulletin board where students can post their comments as well as questions.

## For Students

If you use Slido as a student (i.e., if you are invited to Slido by the host), you need not prepare anything; just receive a URL or QR code from the host and access Slido. (If the host provides you with an "access code" instead of a URL or QR code, enter it in the input box at the top of the [Slido top page](https://www.sli.do/) to open the Slido screen.)

For more information about what you can do with Slido, please see "**[What Students Can Do in Slido](how_to_use_audience)**".
