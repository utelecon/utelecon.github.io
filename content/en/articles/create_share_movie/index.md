### Filming the Video
Here we introduce methods for filming a video through Zoom and PowerPoint. We explain the features of each, so please employ them according to your needs or which you are accustomed to using.

* Zoom
  * The unique feature of Zoom is that you can use its recording function to easily make a video.
  * It is equipped with a standard noise suppression function for voice, so it can maintain a fixed sound quality, even if you do not pay attention to the microphone.

* PowerPoint
  * The unique feature of PowerPoint is that, by using the Record Slideshow function, it is possible to record slide by slide, making it easy to upgrade slides and re-record them.
  * There is no noise suppression function, so we recommend checking the sound recording after.

### Compressing the Video
Here we explain how to compress video using YouTube and VLC Player.
* YouTube
  * For many videos, uploading to, then downloading from, YouTube is an efficient, easy method for compression.
  * It is easy, but because it is necessary to upload first, if the video is too big to upload in the first place, we recommend compressing by VLC Player.
  * [Upload YouTube videos (YouTube Help)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?hl=en)
  * [Download YouTube videos that you've uploaded (YouTube Help)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100?hl=en)
* VLC Player
  * VLC Player's main function is playing media, but it can actually also compress video.
  * It is not necessary to upload anything and you can work locally, so there is no need to worry about the amount you are transmitting.
  * In the Information System Seminar "Creating and Sharing Videos in Work", there is an explanation of how to operate.
    * [Slide](/events/2020-09-02/slides.pdf) (in Japanese): Explanation on Slide 29.

### Sharing the Video
You can release within university by both Google Drive and YouTube.
* Sharing on Google Drive
  * You can also set prohibitions on downloading.
  * **[Concrete Instructions](/faculty_members/how/google/share_video)** (in Japanese)
* Sharing on YouTube
  * If you make availability limited to within the university, it is necessary for others to log into YouTube by their ECCS Cloud Mail address.  There are times when this switchover does not go well for people, so some caution on this point is necessary.
