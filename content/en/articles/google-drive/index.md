## What is Google Drive?

### Description of the Application

Google Drive is a cloud service provided by Google Inc, which allows you to store photos, videos, files, etc. safely and share them in various ways.

### Google Account of the University of Tokyo (ECCS Cloud Email Account)

Members of the University of Tokyo can use Google Drive with their UTokyo Google account (hereinafter referred to as ECCS Cloud Email Account). ECCS Cloud Email Account is a paid account, and has the following differences from the free account for individuals.

* In contrast to the 15 GB storage capacity limit for each personal free account, ECCS Cloud Email Account has unlimited storage capacity.
* You can restrict file sharing in ’My Drive' and shared drives to ECCS Cloud Email Account holders through settings.
* You can become an administrator of the shared drive with a ECCS Cloud Email Account but not with a free personal account.

If you do not have an ECCS Cloud Email Account, please refer to the following article.    
[ECCS Cloud Email (Google Workspace)](https://utelecon.adm.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/eccs_cloud_email)

The following explanation assumes that you are logged in to Google Drive with an ECCS Cloud Email Account.

#### Shared Drive
{:#share_drive}
 
With a shared drive, you can manage files in the drive within your organization. The administrator can grant 5 levels of permissions to members, and can set permissions based on the user's affiliation and job description. If you log in with your ECCS Cloud Email Account, you can use the university shared drive. However, if you log in with your personal account, you are restricted from accessing it.

Shared drives access levels:
	
* **Managerr**: A manager has the highest privilege in the shared drive. You can control the files, members, and settings on the shared drive. (In the case of Google Group, only yourself would be the administrator.)
* **Content Manager**: You can add, edit, move, and delete files. You can add, edit, move, and delete files. However, you cannot manage members and shared drive settings.
* **Contributor**: Can add and edit files. However, it is not possible to move files within the shared drive.
* **Commenter**: You can view and comment on the file. However, you may not be able to download the file depending on the file sharing settings.
* **Viewer**: You can view the file. However, you may not be able to download the file depending on the file sharing settings.

For further details, please refer to the following website. 
* [Overview: What is Shared Drive - Google Workspace Learning Center](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310156?hl=en&ref_topic=9300128)


#### Shared Items

You can see the files and folders that you have shared or that have been shared with you. In a shared drive, the manager has all the rights to files and folders, but in a shared item, the owner (account owner) has all the rights to the files and folders because they are in My Drive of the shared user.

### Differences between My Drive and Shared Drive

#### Features of My Drive

* If the file owner’s account expires, the file will be lost.
* You can share a file by registering the Google account of the person you want to share it with, or simply by sending a link.
* If you want to share a specific file with a specific person, it is recommended to use "My Drive".


#### Features of the Shared Drive

* Files will remain in the shared drive even if the file owner's account expires. The owner must actually delete the file.
* Upon sharing, it is necessary to register Google accounts of all the people with whom the file is shared, because sharing by links is not allowed.
* If you want to share files systematically for a long period of time, it is recommended to use "Shared Drive".

## How to Share Files in My Drive

This section explains how to set the sharing options in My Drive.

1. **Select or create a file to share** 
   1. Log in to [My Drive - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive) using your university Google account (ECCS Cloud Email Account), and open My Drive. 
   2. Select or create the file you want to share. If you are creating a file, click the New button in the upper left corner and create the necessary file. 
   3. When the file you want to share is selected, click the share icon. 
2. **Share the file**: You can share the file by registering the Google account of the person you want to share with, or simply by copying the link and sending it to that person.

    1. You can choose who to share the file with from the following. However, we do not recommend the "only those who know the link" restriction, because it is the same as public sharing if even one of those people divulges the link. Also, you can easily manage permissions by creating folders with different sharing ranges depending on the purpose, and creating files under those folders, rather than setting sharing settings for each file.  
       * University of Tokyo ECCS Cloud Email: All users who are logged in with University of Tokyo ECCS Cloud Email and know the link can view it.  
       * Restricted: A setting that allows only specific people to share the link (a setting that allows only individual users or group members to view the link).  
       * Everyone who knows the link: All people who know the link can see it.   
    2. You can choose the permissions of the people you are sharing the link with from the following.  
        * Viewer: Users can view the file, but cannot modify it or share it with other users.  
        * Commenter: Users can make comments and suggestions, but cannot modify the file or share it with other users.  
        * Editors: Users can make changes, accept or reject suggestions, and share the file with other users.   
4. **Stop or change file sharing**: Go back to Step 3 and apply the appropriate restrictions.

## Tips

### Offline Mode

When using Google Drive, certain file formats can be used offline. The following is a summary of the offline mode of various file formats.

### How to Set Up a Default Account

When you use Google's services, you may be automatically signed in with your personal Google account instead of your university's ECCS Cloud Email Account. If you want to change the default account, click the account icon, log out from all accounts, and then log in with the account you want to use by default.

### Using Google Groups

If you want to share folders and files on your My Drive or shared drive with other users, you can create a Google Group with your class members. This allows you to share on a group basis, and also makes it easier to manage permission.
