### Sharing Your Document
You can share your Google Docs document to collaborate with others.

When you share a document and edit it at the same time, the other users’ cursors appear in different colors so that you can see who is editing where.

You can also grant different permissions (editor, viewer and commenter) for users you are sharing with.  
We will introduce how to share documents and grant permissions. There are two types of sharing methods: "Share with people and groups" and "Get link".

#### Share With People and Groups
Click "Share" in the upper right corner of the screen.  
![](share_doc.png)  
In the "Share with people and groups" field, enter the email addresses or registered names of users you want to share with, and click "Done".  
![](add_user.png)
Select whether or not you want to send a notification email to users you shared the document with. 
You can also select the type of editing permission you give to each user (either "Viewer", who cannot edit the document, or "Commenter", who can only comment, or "Editor", who can edit everything).  
![](share_completed.png)
One "Editor" has been added. The editing permission of an added user can be changed at any time. You can also make a user an owner or remove a user.

#### Get Link
You can share a document by sharing a link to access the document.  
![](pic11.png)  
Under “Get link”, select the range of users to be granted access (either "Restricted", which grants access only to added users, or "東京大学ECCSクラウドメール” (University of Tokyo ECCS Cloud Email), which grants access to users of UTokyo’s ECCS Cloud Email, and "Anyone with link", which grants access to all users you share the link with).
