## Goals

One month has passed since the online class started, in response to the spread of new coronavirus infection. Regarding the use of copyrighted materials, a revised Copyright Act will be put into force early on April 28, 2020 in light of the current situation. We will hold this briefing session as an opportunity to give a basic understanding of how it became possible to use copyrighted works in online classes.<br>
　This briefing is intended for teachers who are actually in charge of education in each department, staff who support education, and TAs.<br>
　At our university, we are currently working on Level 3 to prevent the spread of new coronavirus infections, so we will use Zoom for the briefing.
