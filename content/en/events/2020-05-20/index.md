## Summary

The class supporter program started on April 16, and many teachers are already implementing it in their classes. Although delayed since the start of the program, we will hold a workshop for training of class supporters as follows. <br>　
　 　The contents deal with the purpose and work contents of the class supporter system, and we will open a lot of time for questions and answers. We hope this is an opportunity for teachers and students enrolled as class supporters to know each other. <br>　
　In addition, since our university is currently working on Level 3 to prevent the spread of new coronavirus infection, participation in the training will be provided via Zoom.
