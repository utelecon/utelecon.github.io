## Introduction

- Allows for up to 1000 participants while using a basic license, which makes it suitable for meetings with a large number of participants
- Can host end-to-end encrypted meetings (where the data is not decrypted on the cloud), which means it is recommended for meetings that are highly confidential or where there is a need to avoid censorship
- Offers a variety of features, including voting, breakout rooms, and the ability to mute all participants
- A browser-only version is available that can be used without installing the app, but it is limited to basic functionality
- The app is compatible with Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android (Linux is not supported)
- Starting from March 2021, you will be required to sign in using your UTokyo Account. For more details, see [Signing in to Webex](signin) and [System Change for Spring 2021](/en/change2021s/).
