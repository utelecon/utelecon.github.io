### Recording

* If you record the entire training and upload it on an online platform like ITC-LMS (How to publish: TODO), you can use the recording as a learning material for students with poor communication conditions or as a review material for the class.
* You can start recording anytime during the meeting by clicking the recorder icon.

* Recorded video files are automatically saved in ARF format and saved in "My Training Recordings". You can also get a link (URL) with a password to share.
* Details can be changed from the "Change" button.

### How to Become a Host Again

* When the host gets disconnected due to network trouble, etc., other participants will automatically be assigned to a new host.
* In such case, join the meeting as a participant, press "Change Role To" from the "Participant" menu, and select “Host.”

* If you enable “Attendees can join at least n minutes before the start time” when scheduling the training time, participants can enter the training before the host. If a participant changes his/her own role to the host before the original host joins, he/she will be able to proceed the training as a host.
