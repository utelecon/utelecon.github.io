## How to make a whiteboard or blackboard online 
You can make your whiteboard or blackboard online by setting your PC in front of the board. 
This method only requires a PC and a whiteboard / blackboard. Also it is better to have a  microphone with a high sound collection or a pin microphone.  

* Dr. Yoshihiro Kawahara of the Graduate School of Engineering summarizes the method with one PowerPoint slide. He also records what it looks like[\[Powerpoint\]](materials/online_example_1pc.pptx) [\[video(MPEG4)\]](materials/online_example_1pc.mp4)  
* Dr. Hitoshi Aida of the Graduate School of Engineering has introduced this method on a video including how to set up a PC and a blackboard. He appears between 1:14:57 and 1:24:30 of[a video recording of a consultation meeting on teaching languages online, held on March 27, 2020](../events/2020-03-27/)（We will trim out the section of the video including his part anytime soon）.

## PC，スマホ，書画カメラを用いてオンライン化する
ホワイトボードや黒板の前にPCをセッティングすることで，オンライン化ができます．  
この方法だと，必要な機材は，PC，ホワイトボードや黒板であり，あればより良いのは，集音性の高いマイクかピンマイクです．
