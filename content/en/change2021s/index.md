## Zoom/Webex Made Accessible for UTokyo Account
{:#zoom_webex}

For the use of web conferencing tools such as **Zoom and Webex**, ECCS cloud email (1234567890@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp) and its password were previously indispensable. This is however no longer necessary. **Logging in with UTokyo Account is now possible**.

Your current account (10 digits-ID) will be transferred to your UTokyo Account following the schedule below.

- **Zoom March 14, 2021, 22:00 - March 15, 2021, 6:00 (Scheduled)**
- **Webex March 12, 2021, 20:00 - March 13, 2021, 0:00 (Scheduled)**
