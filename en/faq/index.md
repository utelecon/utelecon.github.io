## Questions regarding classes in general

### Q. What should I do if I cannot join an online class?
* Please consult the following link “[How to join an online class](/en/oc/join)”. It contains information on how to search for online class URLs, common problems, and where to contact when you cannot join a class.

### Q. How do I take attendance?
Some options for taking attendance are:
* Use the ITC-LMS <a href="https://www.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/announcement/2014/05/13_1904.html" target="_blank">attendance management</a> feature
* Answer online questionnaires such as Google Forms or Microsoft Forms
* To avoid fake attendance, require students to answer questions related to the contents of lecture or give feedback on the class.
* To avoid faking attendance, enable the “Collect emails” function when creating Google forms with ECCS Cloud Email account (UTokyo G Suite). Students’ email addresses would be collected for identity confirmation, making it harder for students to fake attendance. To do this, go to “Settings (the gear icon)”, check the box next to "Collect emails" and select “Restrict to users of UTokyo ECCS Cloud Email and its trusted organizations”.
* Call the roll (suitable for smaller size classes using web conference systems). You might have the participants turn on cameras and confirm their identities.
* Use the Zoom Webinar Report; You can use the Webinar Report’s participant join time and exit time information for attendance taking. Details can be found at <a href="/en/zoom/how/faculty_members/attendance" target="_blank"> Zoom for staff: Managing Attendance</a>.

## Zoom

* Our apologies for the inconvenience caused. Kindly adopt romaji and limit the total number of kanji characters to 5 or less.

#### Q. How can I host a large meeting (more than 301 people) in zoom?

#### Q. Can I use my UTokyo Zoom account to host meetings and events outside the university?
* Please refer to the bottom of [this page](/notice/webmeetingaccount20201120.html) for related information before making a decision.
    * As a member of UTokyo, you are welcome to use these services (Zoom, Webex, Google Meets) for research, education, study, and academic purposes. If you wish to host a meeting that exceeds the participant capacity allowed by the university license, please purchase an individual license on your own.

#### Q. How can I edit a single occurrence of a recurring meeting?
* You can set up irregular meeting dates/times in a recurring meeting.  (For example, you may change the day of a meeting regularly scheduled on Tuesdays to a Thursday for a specific week.) In the Zoom web portal, open the recurring meeting you want to edit. In the “Time” section, click “Show all occurrences”, and then “Edit” on the occurrence you want to change.

#### Q. Can I host multiple meetings at the same time?
* You can host up to a maximum of 2 meetings at the same time with an UTokyo Zoom Account. Both meetings need to be started by the original meeting host or by an alternative host.

### Breakout Rooms

#### Q. Can I pre-assign students to breakout rooms?
A. Yes, you can pre-assign students to breakout rooms by importing a CSV file containing each student’s email address and pre-assigned room name. To import a CSV file, access the Zoom web portal, and go to “MY ACCOUNT”->”Meetings”->”Edit”->”Meeting Options”->”Breakout Room pre-assign”. Please note that students need to sign into the Zoom meeting using the email addresses in the CSV file.

Related article: "[Pre-assigning participants to breakout rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360032752671#h_94a5b1d6-4d7d-47e7-aa09-99d5e03bcaa4)"

#### Q. Can I extend breakout time after the breakout session has started?
To be able to extend your breakout time, select the “Notify me when time is up” option when you create the breakout session. Once the session time is over, you will receive a notification. Select “keep breakout rooms open” to extend session time.  

#### Q. Is there an effective way to sort students on the participant list to make grouping easier for breakout sessions?
A. Sorting students on the participant list can be done easily by changing the students’ “Display name”. During the Zoom meeting, ask your students to add numbers or discussion topics to the beginning of their “Display name” (e.g. “01 Smith”, “ Topicxxx Smith”). The students with the same number/discussion topic will show together on the participant list, making it easier to assign them to the same group.


#### Q. Can the co-host create a breakout room?
A. Yes, the co-host can create a breakout room for December 2020 version 5.4.6 or higher. Please try updating your Zoom App if the feature is not enabled.  

#### Q. Can the co-host join a breakout room?
A. Co-hosts can freely join/leave breakout rooms, just like the host.
