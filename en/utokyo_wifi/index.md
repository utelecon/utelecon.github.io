UTokyo WiFi accounts expire at the end of October for the Spring Semester and at the end of April for the Autumn Semester. New accounts can be issued before the start of each semester, so if you want to continue using UTokyo WiFi, you need to reissue an account each semester.

- Once the account has been reissued, enter the user ID and password for the new account into the device you use and connect to it.
    - If the device remembers your previous UTokyo WiFi account information and you are not able to change it (i.e., screen to enter a new user ID and password does not appear), please delete your Wi-Fi account information on the device. The specific method of the removal varies depending on the OS and device type, so please refer to the manual of the respective device.
