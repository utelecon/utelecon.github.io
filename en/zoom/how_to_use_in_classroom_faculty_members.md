title: Using Zoom in class（for instructors）
---

In this section, we introduce how teachers can use Zoom in classroom through interactive videos.   
We hope that you understand that there are some differences from general web conference usage when compared to specialized in classes.  
Also, since we aim to make as many videos as possible, we hope that you understand that the editing is simple.

## Creating a recurrent meeting for a 13 classes courses, and using a single URL
By scheduling regular meetings, you can create a conference room with a common URL to be used over the semester.  
However, it is important to note that you can set up a recurring meeting **only from a Web browser**.  
First, sign in to your <a href="https://zoom.us/profile" target="_blank">Zoom My Page</a> with your account and press "Schedule a Meeting" in the upper right corner.
Check the box "Regular Meeting" in the settings, so you can schedule a regular meeting using the same URL.
Please refer to the following video (in Japanese) for details on how to use this function.

## Presenting PowerPoint and Word materials（Screen sharing）
During class, students can see the screen the teacher is looking at by pressing the Zoom menu "Share screen" → "Screen" → "Share".  
Like that, you can continue your lecture while showing Powerpoint presentations or Word files.
When you finish sharing the screen, press "Stop Sharing" at the top or bottom of the screen. 
  * With the method described above, the entire screen is displayed, so you may unintentionally share your personal information. Instead, it is possible to share not the entire screen but only the window of interest. Like that, you do not need to worry about opening personal information to participants.
  * 
While sharing the screen, the menu is hidden at the top or bottom of the screen. Hover the mouse icon over the meeting ID displayed to the left of “Stop sharing” to display other menu such as “Manage participants”. 
  * 
During screen sharing, the screen of the student's PC is set as full screen and cannot be moved to another window. Here, if the student double-clicks on the Zoom screen, it will not be displayed in full screen, and it will be easier to move to another window.If you want your students to use a window other than Zoom, such as a web browser, while the teacher is sharing the screen, we recommend you to instruct participants to double-click the Zoom screen.
