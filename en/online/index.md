title: Effective Use of Online Resources
---

## Introduction
{:#intro}

This page introduces how to utilize various online tools in university experiences and their actual implementation. Utilizing online tools improves not only online class quality, but also potentially university experience in various areas, including teaching and learning, research, work, and extracurricular activities. For example, by leveraging online conferencing systems, students/faculty/staff in distant locations can share ideas and information more actively.    

To support university members who are looking for ways to leverage online resources, we have compiled useful information in an easy-to-understand, easy-to-access manner. Such information include articles posted on “utelecon” (this portal site) to introduce online tools, information shared by UTokyo members regarding utilization of online resources, and useful articles posted outside of the UTokyo website.  
We also plan to further enrich this page with more methods and practical examples of utilizing various resources, based on our experiences with online classes and activities from academic year 2020 and onward.    
Please keep checking back for more updates.
