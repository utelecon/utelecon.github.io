About this Site
---------------------------

* Many apologies for the site primarily in Japanese (yet).  Working around the clock to put everything barely in good shape ...
* We will work on translations, but meanwhile, please use the "English (Google Translation)" link to machine-translate the page.

* This site aims to provide information on online classes and Web conferences for students and faculty at the University of Tokyo.  
* Please understand that the situation is changing every day and that this Portal has being created in a hurry, so you will find places still under construction or with content being frequently updated.
* This site has been set up by the Information Technology Center of the University of Tokyo and the University Education and Research Center, and welcomes further collaborators.
