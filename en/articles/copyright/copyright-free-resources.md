## Summary of This Article

In the article [What is Public Domain, Creative Commons](public-domain-creative-commons-license)? (also on this site) we explain how to use content without infringing on copyrights when creating course materials as a teacher, or when creating presentation slides or promotional materials for club activities as a student.
As an additional resource, this page introduces websites providing content that falls under the public domain and that is licensed under a Creative Commons license (hereafter referred to as "CC license"). Please use this page as a reference when searching for content.
The tags "Text," "Data," "Image," "Video," and "Audio" under each website name indicate the type of content provided by the website (as of 2022).
Since the spread of the new coronavirus, attention to openly available content has increased worldwide. Please note that the websites introduced on this page are a mixture of Japanese, English, and other foreign languages.

### Sites Distributing General Materials

The following are websites that do not limit themselves to specific genres but deal comprehensively with information in all fields.

#### Wikimedia Foundation

The Wikimedia Foundation operates a variety of projects that provide content in the public domain or under CC licenses. Note that some types of CC licenses require separate permissions or credits.

For example, if you are looking for a picture of a giraffe, instead of searching for "giraffe" on the Internet and randomly selecting your favorite image from the search results, you can find safer materials more quickly by searching for “giraffe Wikipedia” or “giraffe Wikimedia Commons”, or by entering “giraffe” in the Wikimedia Commons site search.
