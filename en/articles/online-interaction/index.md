title: Using Online Meeting Tools to Interact
---


## Highlights of This Article

A comparison of online interaction tools that may be useful for online conferences and meetings.

**Recommended for students and teachers who:**
* Want to discuss matters with other teachers, but are unsure what services to use
* Want to share ideas and facilitate online meetings, but are unsure what tools to use
* Want to be able to assign rooms more easily and intuitively, as assigning breakout sessions in Zoom is difficult

In the following sections, we will compare four meeting tools to help you organize online meetings and conferences: Discord, Wonder, Gather Town, and Remo.

## Discord

### What Is Discord?

Discord is a tool for online voice chat (conversation through voice). It can be used not only for individual chatting, but also for multiple people talking as well as exchanging text, images and videos. It is often used as a chat application during gameplay, but it is also a very useful tool for general calls.

### Basic Usage of Discord

1. Go to the [Discord homepage](https://discord.com) on your browser, install the app, and create an account.
2. Press the + button on the left side of the screen to create a server (a room where you can chat). We recommend that you set the server name to the name of your community or organization. 
3. Invite your friends to the server and start chatting.

### What You Can Do in Discord

1. **Voice Chat**: You can create a voice channel and enjoy voice calls with multiple people. Noise reduction and easy grouping are available. 
2. **Text chat**: You can also use the text channel to conduct a text conversation.
3. **Screen sharing**: During voice chat, you can share your computer screen with your caller by clicking on the TV icon. 
4. **Video chatting**: You can use video chatting not only between individuals, but also between multiple people by setting up a group DM in advance.
5. **Shortcuts**: In order to use these functions, shortcut keys are adopted, for example, "Alt+↑" or "Alt+↓" to move between channels, "Ctrl+Enter" to answer incoming calls, and so on. This allows you to take quick actions when you are taking minutes or doing other tasks, and helps to facilitate meetings.

### What Is Wonder?

Wonder is a relatively new conference tool that allows you to intuitively move between rooms (equivalent to breakout rooms in Zoom) by moving your icon on the screen. You can also create rooms with hundreds of people, and within those rooms, individuals can talk to everyone. The main advantage is that you can intuitively change who you are talking to by moving your icon on the screen.

### Basic Usage of Wonder

1. Go to the [Wonder site](https://www.wonder.me/), click the "Get a room" button, register your name and email address, and create a room. 
2. Share the URL with the person you want to chat with, and ask them to enter the room. 
3. In addition to the normal chatting function, you can divide a room into smaller rooms, and a specific person can speak to all the audience.

### Things You Can Do With Wonder

1. **Large meetings**: Wonder can hold up to 1500 participants at once. You can create a room and then create a smaller room called Circle, so you don't have to deal with too many participants. 
2. **Smooth room movement**: Participants can see who is talking to whom, and can join others conversations by moving between Circles. You can also invite specific participants to your Circle. 
3. **Screen sharing**: You can share your computer screen as in other services. 
4. **Broadcast**: You can talk to everyone in the room. Up to six participants can use this feature at the same time, making it useful for panel discussions. 
5. **Text chat**: You can send messages to specific individuals directly, participants within the Circle and all participants, which is useful for note taking ideas in the circle, reminding people of the time during group discussions, and many others.
